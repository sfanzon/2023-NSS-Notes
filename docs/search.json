    "text": "The first aim of this lecture notes is to rigorously introduce the set of real numbers, which is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). But what do we mean by real numbers? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers) \\[\n\\mathbb{N}= \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,\\dots\\}\n\\]\nOn this set we have a notion of sum of two numbers, denoted as usual by \\[\nn+m\n\\]\nfor \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Here the symbol \\(\\in\\) denotes that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(3+7\\) results in \\(10\\).\n\nQuestion 1Can the sum be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nn+x = m \\,?\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\nOf course to invert (1.1) we can just perform a subtraction, implying that\n\\[\nx = m - n \\,.\n\\]\nBut there is a catch. In general \\(x\\) does not need to be in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). For example, take \\(n=10\\) and \\(m=1\\). Then \\(x = -9\\), which does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Therefore the answer to Question 1 is NO.\nTo make sure that we can always invert the sum, we need to extend the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). This is done simply by introducing the set of integers \\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ -n,n \\, \\colon \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,,\n\\]\nthat is, the set\n\\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ \\ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots \\} \\,.\n\\]\nThe sum can be extended to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), by defining \\[\n(-n) + (-m) := - (m+n)\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nfor all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Now every element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) possesses an inverse, that is, for each \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), there exists \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), such that \\[\nn + m = 0 \\,.\n\\]\nCan we characterize \\(m\\) explicitly? Of course! Seeing the definition at (1.2), we simply have \\[\nm = - n \\,.\n\\]\nOn the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we can also define the operation of multiplication, in the usual way we learnt in school. For \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), we denote the multiplication by \\(nm\\) or \\(n \\cdot m\\). For example \\(7 \\cdot 2 = 14\\) and \\(1 \\cdot (-1) = -1\\).\n\nQuestion 2Can the multiplication in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\[\nnx = m \\,?\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\n\nTo invert (1.3) if \\(n \\neq 0\\), we can just perform a division, to obtain \\[\nx = \\frac{m}{n} \\,.\n\\] But again there is a catch. Indeed taking \\(n=2\\) and \\(m=1\\) yields \\(x = 1/2\\), which does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The answer to Question 2 is therefore NO.\nThus, in order to invert the multiplication, we need to extend the set of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). This extension is called the set of rational numbers, defined by \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}:= \\left\\{ \\frac{m}{n} \\, \\colon \\, m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\, n \\neq 0    \\right\\} \\,.\n\\] We then extend the operations of sum and multiplication to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by defining \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{p}{q} := \\frac{mq + np}{nq}\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} \\, \\cdot \\, \\frac{p}{q} := \\frac{mp}{nq}\n\\] Now the multiplication is invertible in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Specifically, each non-zero element has an inverse: the inverse of \\(m/n\\) is given by \\(n/m\\).\nTo summarize, we have extended \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). By construction we have \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] Moreover sum and product are invertible in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Now we are happy right? So and so.\n\nQuestion 3Can we draw the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)?\n\n\nIt is clear how to draw \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), as seen below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Representation of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n\nHowever \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is much larger than the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) represented by the ticks in Figure 1.1. What do we mean by larger? For example, consider \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nQuestion 4What is the number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) which is closest to \\(0\\)?\n\n\nThere is no right answer to the above question, since whichever rational number \\(m/n\\) you consider, you can always squeeze the rational number \\(m / (2n)\\) in between: \\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{m}{2n} &lt; \\frac{m}{n} \\,.\n\\] For example think about the case of the numbers \\[\n\\frac1n \\, \\text{ for } \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\, n \\neq 0 \\,.\n\\] Such numbers get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\), as depicted below.\n\n\n\nFractions \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\)\n\n\nMaybe if we do the same reasoning with other progressively smaller rational numbers, we manage to fill out the interval \\([0,1]\\). In other words, we might conjecture the following.\n\nConjecture 5Maybe \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) can be represented by a continuous line.\n\n\nDo you think the above conjecture is true? If it was, mathematics would be quite boring. Indeed Conjecture 5 is false, as shown by the Theorem below.\n\nTheorem 6The number \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\nTheorem 6 is the reason why \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is called an irrational number. For reference, a few digits of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are given by \\[\n\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048\\ldots\n\\] and the situation is as in the picture below.\n\n\n\nRepresenting \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) on the numbers line.\n\n\nWe can therefore see that Conjecture 5 is false, and \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is not a line: indeed \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a gap at \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Let us see why Theorem 6 is true.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 6\nWe prove that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] by contradiction.\nWait, what does this mean? Proving the claim by contradiction means assuming that the claim is false. This means we assume that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\tag{1.4}\\] From this assumption we then start deducing other statements, hoping to encounter a statement which is FALSE. But if (1.4) leads to a false statement, then it must be that (1.4) is FALSE. Thus the contrary of (1.4) must hold, meaning that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] as we wanted to show. This would conclude the proof.\nNow we need to actually show that (1.4) will lead to a contradiction. Since this is our first proof, let us take it slowly, step-by-step.\n\nAssuming (1.4) just means that there exists \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\nq = \\sqrt{2} \\, .\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nSince \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), by definition we have \\[\nq = \\frac{m}{n}\n\\] for some \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(n \\neq 0\\).\nRecalling (1.5), we then have \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\]\nWe can square the above equation to get \\[\n\\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2 \\,.\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nWithouth loss of generality, we can assume that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have no common factors.\n\nWait. What does Step 5 mean? You will encounter the sentence withouth loss of generality many times in mathematics. It is often abbreviated in WLOG. WLOG means that the assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general.\nFor example in our case we can assume that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have no common factor. This is because if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) had common factors, then it would mean \\[\nm = a \\tilde{m} \\,, \\quad n = a \\tilde{n}\n\\] for some \\(a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(a \\neq 0\\). Then \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{ a \\tilde{m} }{ a \\tilde{n} } =\n\\frac{ \\tilde{m} }{ \\tilde{n} } \\,.\n\\] Therefore by (1.6) \\[\n\\frac{ \\tilde{m}^2 }{ \\tilde{n}^2 } = 2 \\,.\n\\] The proof can now proceed in the same way we would have proceeded from Step 4, but in addition we have the hypothesis that \\(\\tilde{m}\\) and \\(\\tilde{n}\\) have no common factors.\n\nEquation (1.6) implies \\[\nm^2 = 2 n^2 \\,.\n\\tag{1.7}\\] Therefore the integer \\(m^2\\) is an even number.\n\nWhy is \\(m^2\\) even? As you already know, even numbers are \\[\n0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \\ldots\n\\] All these numbers have in common that they can be divided by \\(2\\), and so they can be written as \\[\n2 p\n\\] for some \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(52\\) is even, because \\[\n52 = 2 \\cdot 26 \\,.\n\\] Instead, odd numbers are \\[\n1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, \\ldots\n\\] These can be all written as \\[\n2p + 1\n\\] for some \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(53\\) is odd, because \\[\n52 = 2 \\cdot 26 + 1 \\,.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(m\\) is an even number, and so there exists \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nm = 2p \\,.\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\nWhy is (1.8) true? Let us see what happens if we take the square of an even number \\(m = 2p\\) \\[\nm^2 = (2p)^2 = 4p^2 = 2 (2p^2) = 2 q \\,.\n\\] Thus \\(m^2 = 2 q\\) for some \\(q\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and so \\(m^2\\) is an even number. If instead \\(m\\) is odd, then \\(m = 2p + 1\\) and \\[\nm^2 = (2p + 1 )^2 = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 = 2(2 p^2 + 2p) + 1\n\\] showing that also \\(m^2\\) is odd.\nThis justifies Step 7: Indeed we know that \\(m^2\\) is an even number from Step 6. If \\(m\\) was odd, then \\(m^2\\) would be odd. Hence \\(m\\) must be even as well.\n\nIf we substitute (1.8) in (1.7) we get \\[\nm^2 = 2n^2 \\, \\implies \\,  (2p)^2 = 2n^2 \\, \\implies \\,  4 p^2 = 2 n^2\n\\] Dividing both terms by \\(2\\), we obtain \\[\nn^2 = 2p^2\\,.\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\nWe now make a series of observations:\n\nEquation (1.9) says that \\(n^2\\) is even.\nStep 6 says that \\(m^2\\) is even.\nTherefore \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are also even.\n\nHence \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) have \\(2\\) as common factor.\nBut Step 5 says that \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) have no common factors.\nCONTRADICTION\n\nOur reasoning has run into a contradiction, starting from assumption (1.4), which says that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] Hence the above must be FALSE, and so \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\,\n\\] ending the proof.\n\n\n\nSeeing that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), we might be tempted to just fill in the gap by adding \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). However, with analogous proof to Theorem 6, we can prove that \\[\n\\sqrt{p} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] for each prime number \\(p\\). As there are infinite prime numbers, this means that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has infinite gaps. Then we might attempt to fill in these gaps via the extension \\[\n\\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} := \\mathbb{Q}\\cup \\{ \\sqrt{p} \\, \\colon \\, p \\, \\text{ prime} \\} \\,.\n\\] However even this is not enough, as we would still have numbers which are not contained in \\(\\tilde{Q}\\), for example \\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} , \\, \\pi , \\, \\pi + \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} \\,.\n\\]\n\nRemark 7Proving that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] is relatively easy, and will be left as an exercise. Instead, proving that \\[\n\\pi \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] is way more complicated. There are several proof of the fact, all requiring mathematics which is more advanced of the one presented in this course. For some proofs, see this Wikipedia page.\n\n\nThe reality of things is that to complete \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) and make it into a continuous line we have to add a lot of points. Indeed, we need to add way more points than the ones already contained in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Such extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) will be called \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the set of real numbers. The inclusions will therefore be \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\] The set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is not at all trivial to construct. In fact, at first we will not construct it, but just do the following:\n\nWe will assume that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) exists and satisfies some basic axioms.\nOne of the axioms is that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) fills all the gaps that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has. Therefore \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be thought as a continuous line.\nWe will study the properties of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) which descend from such axioms.\n\nFor example one of the properties of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) will be the following:\n\nTheorem 8: We will prove this in the future\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) contains all the square roots. This means that for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(x \\geq 0\\), we have \\[\n\\sqrt{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\]\n\n\nAt the end of this chapter we will provide a concrete model for the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), to prove once and for all that such set indeed exists.\n\nTheorem 9: We will prove this in the future\nThere exists a set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), called the set of real numbers, which has the following properties:\n\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) extends \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), that is, \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\]\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfies certain axioms.\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) fills all the gaps that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has. In particular \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be represented by a continuous line."

However it is a good exercise in basic logic, so let us do it.\n\nFirst implication \\(\\implies\\):\nSuppose that \\(A=B\\). Let us show that \\(A\\subset B\\). Since \\(A = B\\), this means that all the elements of \\(A\\) are also contained in \\(B\\). Therefore if we take \\(x \\in A\\) we have \\[\nx \\in A \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, x \\in B \\,.\n\\] This shows \\(A \\subset B\\). The proof of \\(B \\subset A\\) is similar.\nSecond implication \\(\\impliedby\\):\nSuppose that \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset A\\). We need to show \\(A=B\\), that is, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same elements. To this end let \\(x \\in A\\). Since \\(A \\subset B\\) then we have \\(x \\in B\\). Thus \\(B\\) contains all the elements of \\(A\\). Since we are also assuming \\(B \\subset A\\), this means that \\(A\\) contains all the elements of \\(B\\). Hence \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) contain the same elements, and \\(A=B\\).\n\n\n\nThe above proposition is very useful when we need to prove that two sets are equal: rather than showing directly that \\(A = B\\), we can prove that \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset A\\).\n\n\n2.3.3 Infinite unions and intersections\nSuppose given a set \\(\\Omega\\), and a family of sets \\(A_n \\subset \\Omega\\), where \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then we can define the infinte union \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in A_n \\,\\, \\text{ for at least one } \\,\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,.\n\\] The infinte intersection is defined as \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in A_n \\,\\, \\text{ for all } \\,\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,.\n\\]\n\nExample 8Let the ambient set be \\(\\Omega:=\\mathbb{N}\\) and define the family \\(A_n\\) by \\[\\begin{align}\nA_1 & := \\{ 1, 2, 3 , 4 , \\ldots \\} \\\\\nA_2 & := \\{ 2, 3 , 4 , 5, \\ldots \\} \\\\\nA_3 & := \\{ 3 , 4 , 5, 6, \\ldots \\} \\\\\n& \\ldots \\ldots  \\\\\nA_n & := \\{ n, n+1, n+2, n+3,  \\ldots \\} \\,,\n\\end{align}\\] for arbitrary \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n = \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\tag{2.2}\\] The above equality can be easily proven using Proposition 7. Indeed, assume that \\(m \\in \\cup_n A_n\\). Then \\(m \\in A_n\\) for at least one \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Since \\(A_n \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\), we conclude that \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). This shows \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] Conversely, suppose that \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). By definition \\(m \\in A_m\\). Hence there exists at least one index \\(n\\), \\(n=m\\) in this case, such that \\(m \\in A_n\\). Then by definition \\(m \\in \\cup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n\\), showing that \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\,.\n\\] Hence we conclude (2.2) by Proposition 7.\nWe also have that \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n = \\emptyset \\,.\n\\tag{2.3}\\] We prove the above by contradiction. Indeed, suppose that (2.3) is false, i.e., \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\neq \\emptyset \\,.\n\\] This means there exists some \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(m \\in \\cap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n\\). Hence, by definition, \\(m \\in A_n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). However \\(m \\notin A_{m+1}\\), yielding a contradiction. Thus (2.3) holds.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Complement\nSuppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are subsets of a larger set \\(\\Omega\\). The complement of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(B\\) is the set of elements of \\(B\\) which do not belong to \\(A\\), that is \\[\nB \\smallsetminus A := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in B \\, \\text{ and } \\, x \\notin A \\} \\,.\n\\] In particular, the complement of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(\\Omega\\) is denoted by \\[\nA^c := \\Omega \\smallsetminus A := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\notin A \\} \\,.\n\\]\n\nRemark 9Suppose that \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) form a partition of \\(\\Omega\\), in the sense that \\[\nA \\cup A^c = \\Omega  \\,\\, \\text{ and } \\,\\,  A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 10\nSuppose \\(A, B \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\[\nA \\subset B  \\iff B^c \\subset A^c \\,.\n\\]\nLet us prove the above claim:\n\nFirst implication \\(\\implies\\):\nSuppose that \\(A \\subset B\\). We need to show that \\(B^c \\subset A^c\\). Hence, assume \\(x \\in B^c\\). By definition this means that \\(x \\notin B\\). Now notice that we cannot have that \\(x \\in A\\). Indeed, assume \\(x \\in A\\). By assumption we have \\(A \\subset B\\), hence \\(x \\in B\\). But we had assumed \\(x \\in B\\), contradiction. Therefore it must be that \\(x \\notin A\\). Thus \\(B^c \\subset A^c\\).\nSecond implication \\(\\impliedby\\):\nEssentially the same proof, hence we omit it.\n\n\n\n\nWe conclude by stating the De Morgan’s Laws. The proof will be left as an exercise.\n\nProposition 11: De Morgan’s LawsSuppose \\(A,B \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\[\n(A \\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c\n\\] and \\[\n(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c  \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Power set\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be an arbitray set. We define the power set of \\(\\Omega\\) as \\[\n\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) := \\{ A \\, \\colon \\,A \\subset \\Omega \\}\\,,\n\\] that is, the power set of \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nRemark 12\nIt holds that:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) is always non-empty, since we have that \\[\n\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\,,  \\quad  \\Omega \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\,.\n\\]\nGiven \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\), then the sets \\[\nA \\cup B, \\quad  A \\cap B ,\\quad A^c , \\quad B \\smallsetminus A\n\\] are all elements of \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\).\nSuppose \\(\\Omega\\) is discrete and finite, that is, \\[\n\\Omega = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_m\\}\n\\] for some \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) contains \\(2^m\\) elements.\n\nThis is because for each \\(x_i \\in \\Omega\\) we have just two choices: either include \\(x_i\\) in a subset, or do not include \\(x_i\\) in a subset.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13Define the set \\[\n\\Omega = \\{ x, y, z \\}\\,.\n\\] Then \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) has \\(2^3 = 8\\) elements. These are\n\n\\(\\emptyset\\)\n\\(\\{x\\}\\)\n\\(\\{y\\}\\)\n\\(\\{z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,y\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{y,z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,y,z\\}\\)\n\nWe therefore write \\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) = \\{ \\emptyset, & \\, \\{x\\} , \\,  \\{y\\} , \\, \\{z\\} , \\{x,y\\} \\\\\n&  \\{x,z\\}, \\, \\{y,z\\} , \\, \\{x,y,z\\} \\} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Product of sets\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two sets. The product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of pairs \\[\nA \\times B := \\{ (a,b) \\, \\colon \\, a \\in A, \\, b \\in B \\} \\,.\n\\] By definition two elements in \\(A \\times B\\) are the same, in symbols \\[\n(a, b) = (\\tilde{a}, \\tilde{b})\n\\] if and only if they are equal component-by-componenent, that is \\[\na=\\tilde{a}\\,, \\qquad b = \\tilde{b} \\,.\n\\]"

The quotient space is then \\[\n\\mathbb{N}/ R = \\{ [x] \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{  \\{ x\\} \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}  \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 17Suppose that \\(R\\) is a binary relation on the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers defined by \\[\nx \\sim y  \\iff x-y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\,.\n\\] Then \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Indeed:\n\nReflexive: Let \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Then \\(x-x = 0\\) and \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Thus \\(x \\sim x\\).\nSymmetric: If \\(x \\sim y\\) then \\(x-y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). But then also\n\\[\n-(x-y) = y - x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\] and so \\(y \\sim x\\).\nTransitive: Suppose \\(x \\sim y\\) and \\(y \\sim z\\).

This shows that \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nNow note that \\[\ny \\sim x \\iff y -x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\] and the above is equivalent to \\[\n\\exists \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, y - x = n\n\\] which again is equivalent to \\[\n\\exists \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, y = x + n \\,.\n\\] Therefore all the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) related to \\(x\\) by \\(R\\) are of the form \\[\nx + n \\,, \\, \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\,.\n\\] The equivalence classes with respect to \\(R\\) are then \\[\n[x] = \\{  x + n \\ \\colon \\ n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}  \\,.\n\\] Each equivalence class has exactly one element in \\([0,1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\), meaning that: \\[\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\,\\, \\exists! \\, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\text{ s.t } \\, 0 \\leq q &lt; 1 \\, \\text{ and } \\, q \\in [x]\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}/ R = \\{ [x] \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\} = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,0 \\leq q &lt;1  \\} \\,.\n\\]"

It is a very important inequality, which we will use a lot in the future.\n\nTheorem 35: Triangle inequalityFor every \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) we have \\[\n| |x| - |y| | \\leq |x-y| \\leq |x| + |y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\n\n\nBefore proceeding with the proof, let us discuss the geometric meaning of the triangle inequality.\n\nRemark 36: Geometric meaning of triangle inequalityThe notion of absolute value can be extended also to vectors in the plane. Suppose that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two vectors in the plane, as in Figure 2.8 below. Then \\(|x|\\) and \\(|y|\\) can be interpreted as the lengths of these vectors.\nUsing the rule of sum of vectors, we can draw \\(x+y\\), as shown in Figure 2.9 below.

We prove the two inequalities in (2.7) individually.\nStep 1. Proof of the second inequality in (2.7).\nTrivially we have \\[\n|x| \\leq |x| \\,.\n\\] Therefore we can apply Lemma 33 and infer \\[\n-|x| \\leq x \\leq |x| \\,.\n\\tag{2.9}\\] Similarly we have that \\(|y| \\leq |y|\\), and so Lemma 33 implies \\[\n-|y| \\leq y \\leq |y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.10}\\] Summing (2.9) and (2.10) we get \\[\n-(|x| + |y|) \\leq x + y \\leq |x| + |y| \\,.\n\\] We can now again apply Lemma 33 to get \\[\n|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y| \\,,\n\\tag{2.11}\\] which is the second inequality in (2.7).\nStep 2. Proof of the second inequality in (2.7).\nNote that the trivial identity \\[\nx = x+y - y\n\\] always holds. We then have \\[\\begin{align}\n|x| & = |x+y - y| \\\\\n    & = |(x+y) + (-y)| \\\\\n    & = |a+b|\n\\end{align}\\] with \\(a=x+y\\) and \\(b=-y\\). We can now apply (2.11) to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to obtain \\[\\begin{align}\n|x| & = |a+b| \\\\\n    & \\leq |a| + |b| \\\\\n    & = |x+y| + |-y| \\\\\n    & = |x+y| + |y|\n\\end{align}\\] Therefore \\[\n|x| - |y| \\leq |x+y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.12}\\] We can now swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in (2.12) to get \\[\n|y| - |x| \\leq |x+y| \\,.\n\\] By rearranging the above inequality we obtain \\[\n-|x+y| \\leq |x| - |y|  \\,.\n\\tag{2.13}\\] Putting together (2.12) and (2.13) yields \\[\n-|x+y| \\leq |x| - |y| \\leq |x+y| \\,.  \n\\] By Lemma 33 the above is equivalent to \\[\n||x| - |y|| \\leq |x+y| \\,,\n\\] which is the first inequality in (2.7).\n\n\nAn immediate consequence of the triangle inequality are the following inequalities, which are left as an exercise.\n\nRemark 37For any \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) it holds \\[\n||x|-|y|| \\leq |x-y| \\leq |x|+|y|\\,.\n\\] Moreover for any \\(x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) it holds \\[\n|x-y| \\leq |x-z| + |z-y| \\,.\n\\]"

Common strategies to prove (2.14) are:\n\nContradiction: Assume that the thesis is false, and hope to reach a contradiction: that is, prove that \\[\n\\neg \\beta \\implies \\, \\mbox{ contradiction}\n\\] where \\(\\neg \\beta\\) is the negation of \\(\\beta\\).\n\nFor example we already proved by contradiction that \\[\n\\mbox{Definition of } \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\implies \\, \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\,,\n\\] In the above statement \\[\n\\alpha = \\left( \\mbox{Definition of } \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\] \\[\n\\beta = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\neg \\beta  = \\left(  \\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\]\n\nDirect: Sometimes proofs will also need direct arguments, meaning that one need to show directly that (2.14) holds.\nContrapositive: The statement (2.14) is equivalent to \\[\n\\neg \\beta \\, \\implies \\, \\neg \\alpha \\,.\n\\tag{2.15}\\] Thus, instead of proving (2.14), one could show (2.15). The statement (2.15) is called the contrapositive of (2.14).\n\nLet us make an example.\n\nProposition 38Two real numbers \\(a,b\\) are equal if and only if for every real number \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) it follows that \\(|a-b|&lt;\\varepsilon\\).\n\n\nBefore proceeding with the proof, note that the above stetement is just saying that:\n\nTwo numbers are equal if and only if they are arbitrarily close\n\nBy arbitrarily close we mean that they are as close as you want the to be.\n\nProof: of Proposition 38Let us first rephrase the statement using mathematical symbols:\n\nLet \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).

Proof that \\(\\alpha \\implies \\beta\\).\nThis proof can be carried out by a direct argument. Since we are assuming \\(\\alpha\\), this means \\[\na=b \\,.\n\\] We want to see that \\(\\beta\\) holds. Therefore fix an arbitrary \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\). This means that \\(\\varepsilon\\) can be any positive number, as long as you fix it. Clearly \\[\n|a-b| = |0| = 0 &lt; \\varepsilon\n\\] since \\(a=b\\), \\(|0|=0\\), and \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\). The above shows that \\[\n|a-b| &lt; \\varepsilon\\,.\n\\] As \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) was arbitrary, we have just proven that \\[\n|a-b| &lt; \\varepsilon\\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, \\varepsilon&gt;0 \\,,\n\\] meaning that \\(\\beta\\) holds and the proof is concluded.\nStep 2. Proof that \\(\\beta \\implies \\alpha\\).\nLet us prove this implication by showing the contrapositive \\[\n\\neg \\alpha \\implies \\neg\\beta \\,.\n\\] So let us assume \\(\\neg \\alpha\\) is true. This means that \\[\na \\neq b \\,.\n\\] We have to see that \\(\\neg \\beta\\) holds. But \\(\\neg \\beta\\) means that \\[\n\\exists \\, \\varepsilon_0&gt; 0 \\, \\text{ s.t } \\, |a-b| \\geq \\varepsilon_0 \\,.\n\\] The above is satisfied by choosing \\[\n\\varepsilon_0 := |a-b| \\,,\n\\] since \\(\\varepsilon_0 &gt;0\\) given that \\(a \\neq b\\)."

This means that something which looks elementary needs to be assumed to hold, in order to have a starting point for proving deeper statements.\nIn the case of the Principle of Induction, the intuition is clear:\n\nThe Principle of Induction is just describing the domino effect: If one tile falls, then the next one will fall as well. Therefore if the first tile falls, all the tiles will fall.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume such evident principle.\n\n\nThe Principle of Induction can be used to prove statements which depend on some index \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).

Note that we could not have defined \\[\n1 + 1  = 2\\,,\n\\] since \\(2 \\notin K\\).\n\n\nBinary operations take ordered pairs of elements of \\(K\\) as input.

Indeed we have already shown in Example 5 that:\n\n(A1) and (M1) hold,\n(A2) holds with neutral element \\(0\\),\n(M2) holds with neutral element \\(1\\),\n(A3) every element has an additive inverse, with \\[\n-0 = 0 \\,, \\quad - 1 = 1 \\,,\n\\]\n(M3) every element which is not \\(0\\) a multiplicative inverse, with \\[\n1^{-1} = 1\\,.\n\\]\n\nWe are left to show the Distributive Property (AM). Indeed:\n\n(AM) For all \\(y,z \\in K\\) we have \\[\n0 \\cdot (y + z) = 0 \\,, \\quad (0 \\cdot y) + (0 \\cdot z) = 0 + 0 = 0\\,,\n\\] and also \\[\n1 \\cdot (y + z) = y + z \\,, \\quad (1 \\cdot y) + (1 \\cdot z) = y + z \\,.\n\\] Thus (AM) holds.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 9: Subtraction and division\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. We define:\n\nSubtraction as the operation \\(-\\) defined by \\[\nx - y := x + (-y) \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x , y \\in K \\,,\n\\] where \\(-y\\) is the additive inverse of \\(y\\).\nDivision as the operation \\(/\\) defined by \\[\nx/y := x \\cdot y^{-1}\\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x , y \\in K \\,, \\,\\, y \\neq 0 \\,,\n\\] where \\(y^{-1}\\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nProposition 10: Uniqueness of neutral elements and inverses\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. Then\n\nThere is a unique element in \\(K\\) with the property of \\(0\\),\nThere is a unique element in \\(K\\) with the property of \\(1\\),\nFor all \\(x \\in K\\) there is a unique additive inverse \\(-x\\),\nFor all \\(x \\in K\\), \\(x \\neq 0\\), there is a unique multiplicative inverse \\(x^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\nSuppose that \\(0 \\in K\\) and \\(\\tilde{0} \\in K\\) are both neutral element of \\(+\\), that is, they both satisfy (A2). Then \\[\n0 + \\tilde{0} = 0\n\\] since \\(\\tilde{0}\\) is a neutral element for \\(+\\). Moreover \\[\n\\tilde{0} + 0 = \\tilde{0}\n\\] since \\(0\\) is a neutral element for \\(+\\). By commutativity of \\(+\\), see property (A1), we have \\[\n0 = 0 + \\tilde{0} = \\tilde{0} + 0 = \\tilde{0} \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(0 = \\tilde{0}\\). Hence the neutral element for \\(+\\) is unique.\nExercise.\nLet \\(x \\in K\\) and suppose that \\(y, \\tilde{y} \\in K\\) are both additive inverses of \\(x\\), that is, they both satisfy (A3). Therefore \\[\nx + y = 0\n\\] since \\(y\\) is an additive inverse of \\(x\\) and \\[\nx + \\tilde{y} = 0\n\\] since \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is an additive inverse of \\(x\\). Therefore we can use commutativity and associativity and of \\(+\\), see property (A1), and the fact that \\(0\\) is the neutral element of \\(+\\), to infer \\[\\begin{align}\ny & = y + 0 = y + (x + \\tilde{y}) \\\\\n  & = (y + x) + \\tilde{y} = (x + y) + \\tilde{y} \\\\\n  & = 0 + \\tilde{y} = \\tilde{y} \\,,    \n\\end{align}\\] concluding that \\(y = \\tilde{y}\\). Thus there is a unique additive inverse of \\(x\\), and \\[\ny = \\tilde{y} = -x \\,,\n\\] with \\(-x\\) the element from property (A3).\nExercise.\n\n\n\nUsing the properties of field we can also show that the usual properties of sum, subtraction, multiplication and division still hold in any field. We list such properties in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 11: Properties of field operations\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. Then for all \\(x,y,z \\in K\\),\n\n\\(x + y = x + z \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, y = z\\)\n\\(x \\cdot y = x \\cdot z \\,\\) and \\(\\,x \\neq 0 \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, y = z\\)\n\\(- 0 = 0\\)\n\\(1^{-1} = 1\\)\n\\(x \\cdot 0 = 0\\)\n\\(-1 \\cdot x = -x\\)\n\\(-(-x) = x\\)\n\\((x^{-1})^{-1} = x \\,\\) if \\(\\, x \\neq 0\\)\n\\((x \\cdot y)^{-1} = x^{-1} \\cdot y^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\nThe above properties can be all proven with elementary use of the field properties (A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3) and (AM). This is an exercise in patience, and is left to the reader.\nLet us conclude with examining the sets of numbers introduced in Chapter 1.\n\nTheorem 12\nConsider the sets \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) with the usual operations \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\).

Thus it is only missing (M3), the multiplicative inverse property.\n\\((\\mathbb{Q}, + , \\cdot)\\) is a field.\n\n\n\nThe proof is omitted."

More explicitly, there exist a cut \\((A,B)\\) of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) which has no separator.\n\n\n\nRemark 21Before proceeding with the proof, let us summarize the ideas behind it:\nWe will consider the cut \\((A,B)\\) in (3.1). We then assume by contradiction that \\((A,B)\\) admits a separator \\(L \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), so that \\[\na \\leq L \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, a \\in A\\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Since \\((A,B)\\) is a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), then either \\(L \\in A\\) or \\(L \\in B\\). These will both lead to a contradiction:\n\nIf \\(L \\in A\\), then by definition we will have \\[\nL &lt; \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\] Now the idea is that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), and hence we can always find some \\(\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\nL &lt; \\tilde{L} &lt; \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Therefore \\(\\tilde{L} \\in A\\), and (3.2) implies \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\leq L \\,,\n\\] which contradicts (3.3).\nIf \\(L \\in B\\), then by definition we will have \\[\n\\sqrt{2} &lt; L \\,.\n\\] Similarly, as \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), we can find \\(\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} &lt; \\tilde{L} &lt; L \\,.\n\\] Arguing as above we find a contradiction.\n\nTherefore both \\(L \\in A\\) and \\(L \\in B\\) lead to a contradiction. We conclude that \\((A,B)\\) has no separator in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\nTime to make the ideas in the above remark rigorous.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 20Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the sets defined in (3.1). It is useful to rewrite \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the form \\[\nA = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\,,\n\\] where \\[\nA_1 = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q&lt; 0  \\}\\,,\n\\] \\[\nA_2 =\\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q \\geq 0\\,, \\,\\, q^2 &lt; 2  \\} \\,,\n\\] and \\[\nB = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q &gt; 0, \\,\\, q^2 &gt; 2  \\} \\,.\n\\]\nStep 1. \\((A,B)\\) is a cut of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\):\nWe need to prove the following:\n\n\\((A,B)\\) is a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). This is because \\(A , B \\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\) with \\(A \\neq \\emptyset\\) and \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\). Moreover \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\) and \\[\nA \\cup B = \\mathbb{Q}\\,,\n\\] given that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), and so there is no element \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(q^2 = 2\\).\nIt holds \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\] Indeed, suppose that \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\). We have two cases:\n\n\\(a \\in A_1\\): Therefore \\(a&lt;0\\). In particular \\[\na &lt; 0 &lt; b\\,,\n\\] given that \\(b &gt; 0\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\). Thus \\(a&lt;b\\).\n\\(a \\in A_2\\): Therefore \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(a^2 &lt; 2\\). In particular \\[\na^2 &lt; 2 &lt; b^2 \\,,\n\\] since \\(b^2&gt;2\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\). In particular \\[\na^2 &lt; b^2 \\,.\n\\] Since \\(b&gt;0\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\), from the above inequality we infer \\(a&lt;b\\), concluding.\n\n\nStep 2. \\((A,B)\\) has no separator:\nSuppose by contradiction that \\((A,B)\\) admits a separator \\[\nL \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] By definition this means \\[\na \\leq L \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Since \\[\nL \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\quad \\mathbb{Q}= A \\cup B \\,, \\quad  A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] then either \\(L \\in A\\) or \\(L \\in B\\). We will see that both these possibilities lead to a contradiction:\nCase 1: \\(L \\in A\\).\nBy (3.4) we know that \\[\na \\leq L \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\tag{3.5}\\] In particular the above implies \\[\nL \\geq 0\n\\tag{3.6}\\] since \\(0 \\in A\\). Therefore we must have \\(L \\in A_2\\), that is, \\[\nL \\geq 0 \\,\\, \\mbox{ and } \\,\\, L^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.7}\\] Set \\[\n\\tilde{L} := L + \\frac1n\n\\] for \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(n \\neq 0\\) to be chosen later. Clearly we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,\\,\\, \\mbox{ and } \\,\\,\\, L &lt; \\tilde{L}  \\,.\n\\tag{3.8}\\] From (3.6) and (3.8) we have also \\[\n\\tilde{L}&gt;0 \\,.\n\\tag{3.9}\\] We now want to show that there is a choice of \\(n\\) such that \\(\\tilde{L}^2 &lt; 2\\), which will lead to a contradiction. Indeed, we can estimate \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{L}^2 & = \\left( L + \\frac1n \\right)^2 \\\\\n            & = L^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \\frac{L}{n} \\\\\n            & &lt; L^2 + \\frac{1}{n} + 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n}&lt;\\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n            & = L^2 + \\frac{2L + 1}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] If we now impose that \\[\nL^2 + \\frac{2L + 1}{n} &lt; 2 \\,,\n\\] we can rearrange the above and obtain \\[\nn(2 - L^2) &gt; 2L + 1 \\,.\n\\] Now note that \\(L^2 &lt; 2\\) by assumption (3.7). Thus we can divived by \\((2 - L^2)\\) and obtain \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2} \\,.\n\\] Therefore we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2}  \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, \\tilde{L}^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\] Together with (3.9) this implies \\(\\tilde{L} \\in A\\). Therefore we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\leq L\n\\] by (3.5). On the other hand it also holds \\[\n\\tilde{L} &gt; L\n\\] by (3.8), and therefore we have a contradiction. Thus \\(L \\notin A\\).\nCase 2: \\(L \\in B\\).\nAs \\(L \\in B\\), we have by definition \\[\nL &gt; 0 \\,, \\quad L^2 &gt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.10}\\] Moreover since \\(L\\) is a separator, see (3.4), in particular \\[\nL \\leq b \\,,  \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.11}\\] Define now \\[\n\\tilde{L} := L - \\frac1n\n\\] with \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(n \\neq 0\\) to be chosen later. Clearly we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} &lt; L \\,.\n\\tag{3.12}\\] We now show that \\(n\\) can be chosen so that \\(\\tilde{L} \\in B\\). Indeed \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{L}^2  & = \\left(  L - \\frac1n   \\right)^2 \\\\\n             & = L^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{L}{n} \\\\\n             & &gt; L^2 - \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n             & &gt; L^2 - \\frac{1}{n} - 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, -\\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n}  \\right) \\\\\n             & = L^2 - \\frac{1 + 2L}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] Now we impose \\[\nL^2 - \\frac{1 + 2L}{n} &gt; 2\n\\] which is equivalent to \\[\nn(L^2 - 2) &gt; 1 + 2L \\,.\n\\] Since we are assuming \\(L \\in B\\), then \\(L^2 &gt; 2\\), see (3.10). Therefore we can divide by \\((L^2 -2)\\) and get \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \\,.\n\\] In total, we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tilde{L}^2 &gt; 2\\,,\n\\] proving that \\(\\tilde{L} \\in B\\). Therefore by (3.11) we get \\[\nL \\leq \\tilde{L} \\,.\n\\] This contradicts (3.12).\nConclusion:\nWe have seen that assuming that \\((A,B)\\) has a separator \\(L \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) leads to a contradiction. Thus the cut \\((A,B)\\) has no separator.\n\n\n\nRemark 22The above proof can be summarized by saying that the set \\[\nA = (-\\infty, \\sqrt{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] does not admit a largest element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), and that the set \\[\nB = (\\sqrt{2}, \\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] does not admit a lowest element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). We will clarify this remark in the next section."

Does \\[\n\\sup A\n\\] always exist?\n\n\nThe answer to the above question is NO. Like we did with the Cut Property, the counterexample can be found in the set of rational numbers \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). A set bounded above for which the supremum does nor exist is, for example, \\[\nA = [0, \\sqrt{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\tag{3.13}\\]\n\nTheorem 36\nThere exists a set \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that\n\n\\(A\\) is non-empty,\n\\(A\\) is bounded above,\n\\(\\sup A\\) does not exist in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\n\nThe proof uses the same ideas we used for showing that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) does not have the Cut Property.\n\nProofDefine the set \\(A\\) as in (3.13). Equivalently, this can be written as \\[\nA = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q \\geq 0 \\,, \\,\\, q^2 &lt; 2 \\} \\,.\n\\]\nStep 1. \\(A\\) is bounded above.\nTake \\(b:=9\\). Then \\(b\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\). Indeed by definition \\[\nq^2 &lt; 2 \\,, \\,\\, q \\geq 0 \\,, \\,\\,\\, \\forall q \\in A \\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\nq^2 &lt; 2 &lt; 9  \\implies q^2 &lt; 9 \\implies q &lt; 3 = b \\, .\n\\]\nStep 2. \\(\\sup A\\) does not exist.\nAssume by contradiction that \\[\ns = \\sup A \\in \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] exists. By definition it holds \\[\ns \\geq q \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, q \\in A\n\\tag{3.14}\\] \\[\nb \\geq q \\,, \\, \\forall \\, q \\in A \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\,\ns \\leq b\n\\tag{3.15}\\] There are two possibilities: \\(s \\in A\\) or \\(s \\notin A\\):\n\nCase 1. \\(s \\in A\\).\nIf \\(s \\in A\\) by definition \\[\ns  \\geq 0\\,, \\quad s^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.16}\\] Define \\[\n\\tilde{s} := s + \\frac{1}{n}\n\\] with \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(n \\neq 0\\) to be chosen later. Then \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{s}^2 & = \\left( s + \\frac1n \\right)^2 \\\\\n          & = s^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \\frac{s}{n} \\\\\n          & &lt; s^2 + \\frac{1}{n} + 2 \\frac{s}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n}&lt;\\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n          & = s^2 + \\frac{2s + 1}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] If we now impose that \\[\ns^2 + \\frac{2s + 1}{n} &lt; 2 \\,,\n\\] we can rearrange the above and obtain \\[\nn(2 - s^2) &gt; 2s + 1 \\,.\n\\] Now note that \\(s^2 &lt; 2\\) by assumption (3.16). Thus we can divide by \\((2 - s^2)\\) and obtain \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2} \\,.\n\\] To summarize, we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2}  \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, \\tilde{s}^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\] Moreover \\(\\tilde{s} := (s + 1/n) \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Therefore \\[\n\\tilde{s} \\in A \\,.\n\\] Since \\(s = \\sup A\\), we then have \\[\n\\tilde{s} \\leq s \\,.\n\\] However \\[\n\\tilde{s} := s + \\frac{1}{n} &gt; s \\,,\n\\] yielding a contradiction. Thus \\(s \\in A\\) is not possible.\nCase 2. \\(s \\notin A\\).\nIf \\(s \\notin A\\), by the fact that \\(s = \\sup A\\) and by definition of \\(A\\) we get \\[\ns &gt; 0 \\,, \\quad s^2 &gt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.17}\\]\nDefine \\[\n\\tilde{s} := s - \\frac{1}{n} \\,.\n\\] We have \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{s}^2  & = \\left(  s - \\frac1n   \\right)^2 \\\\\n           & = s^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{s}{n} \\\\\n           & &gt; s^2 - \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{s}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n           & &gt; s^2 - \\frac{1}{n} - 2 \\frac{s}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, -\\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n}  \\right) \\\\\n           & = s^2 - \\frac{1 + 2s}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] Now we impose \\[\ns^2 - \\frac{1 + 2s}{n} &gt; 2\n\\] which is equivalent to \\[\nn(s^2 - 2) &gt; 1 + 2s \\,.\n\\] By (3.17) we have \\(s^2 &gt; 2\\). Therefore we can divide by \\((s^2 -2)\\) and get \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \\,.\n\\] In total, we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tilde{s}^2 &gt; 2\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\(\\tilde{s} \\notin A\\), and by definition of \\(A\\) we have \\[\n\\tilde{s} \\geq q \\,, \\quad \\forall q \\in A\\,.\n\\] Moreover \\(\\tilde{s} := (s - 1/n) \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Therefore \\(\\tilde{s}\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Since \\(s=\\sup A\\) is the smallest upper bound, see (3.15), it follows \\[\ns \\leq \\tilde{s} \\,.\n\\] However \\[\n\\tilde{s} := s - \\frac{1}{n} &lt; s \\,,\n\\] obtaining a contradiction. Then \\(s \\notin A\\).\n\nConclusion.\nWe have assumed by contradiction that \\(s = \\sup A\\) exists in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). In this case either \\(s \\in A\\) or \\(s \\notin A\\). In both cases we found a contradiction. Therefore \\(\\sup A\\) does not exist.\n\n\nThe above theorem shows that the supremum does not necessarily exist. What about the infimum?\n\nQuestion 37Suppose \\((K,+,\\cdot, \\leq)\\) is an ordered field, and that \\(A \\subset K\\) is non-empty and bounded below. Does \\[\n\\inf A\n\\] always exist?\n\n\nThe answer to the above question is again NO. A set bounded below for which the infimum does nor exist is, for example, \\[\nA = (\\sqrt{2}, 10] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] The proof of this fact is, of course, very similar to the one of Theorem 36, and is therefore omitted.\nThus infimum and supremum do not exist in general. The fields for which all the bounded sets admit supremum or infimum are called complete.\n\nDefinition 38: Completeness\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot,\\leq)\\) be an ordered field. We say that \\(K\\) is complete if it holds the property:\n\n(AC) For every \\(A \\subset K\\) non-empty and bounded above \\[\n\\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nNotation 39\nWe have that:\n\nProperty (AC) is called Axiom of Completeness\nIf \\(K\\) is an ordered field in which (AC) holds, then \\(K\\) is called a complete ordered field\n\n\n\nNotice that if the Axiom of Completeness holds, then also the infimum exists. This is shown in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 40Let \\((K,+,\\cdot,\\leq)\\) be a complete ordered field. Suppose that \\(A \\subset K\\) is non-empty and bounded below. Then \\[\n\\inf A \\in K\\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofSuppose that \\(A \\subset K\\) is non-empty and bounded below. Then \\[\n-A:= \\{ -a \\, \\colon \\,a \\in A   \\}\n\\] is non-empty and bounded above. By completeness we have that \\(\\sup(-A)\\) exists in \\(K\\). But then Proposition 34 implies that \\(\\inf A\\) exists in \\(K\\), with \\[\n\\inf A = - \\sup (-A)\\,.\n\\]\n\n\nWe can show that Completeness is equivalent to the Cut Property.\n\nTheorem 41: Equivalence of Cut Property and Completeness\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot, \\leq)\\) be an ordered field. Then they are equivalent:\n\n\\(K\\) has the Cut Property\n\\(K\\) is Complete\n\n\n\n\nProofStep 1. Cut Property \\(\\implies\\) Completeness.\nWe need to prove that \\(K\\) is complete. To this end, consider \\(A \\subset K\\) non-empty and bounded above. Define the set of upper bounds of \\(A\\): \\[\nB := \\{ b \\in K \\, \\colon \\,b \\geq a \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A \\} \\,.\n\\] We have \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\), since \\(A\\) is bounded above.\nClaim. The pair \\((B^c,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\).\nProof of Claim.\n\\((B^c,B)\\) forms a partition of \\(K\\), since \\(B^c \\neq \\emptyset\\). Thus \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\) and \\[\nK = B^c \\cup B \\,, \\quad B^c \\cap B =  \\emptyset \\,.\n\\] Moreover we have \\[\nx \\leq y \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in B^c\\,, \\,\\forall \\, y \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.18}\\] To show the above, let \\(x \\in B^c\\) and \\(y \\in B\\). By definition of \\(B\\) we have that elements of \\(B^c\\) are not upper bounds of \\(A\\). Therefore \\(x\\) is not an upper bound. This means there exists \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\) which is larger than \\(x\\), that is, \\[\nx \\leq \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\] Since \\(y \\in B\\), then \\(y\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\), so that \\[\na \\leq y \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\nx \\leq \\tilde{a} \\leq y \\,,\n\\] concluding (3.18) and the claim.\nSince \\((B^c,B)\\) is a cut, by the Cut Propery there exists a separator \\(s \\in K\\) such that \\[\nx \\leq s \\leq y \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in B^c\\,, \\,\\forall \\, y \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nClaim. \\(s\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\).\nProof of Claim.\nSuppose by contradiction that \\(s\\) is not an upper bound for \\(A\\). Therefore by definition of upper bound, there exists \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\) such that \\[\ns &lt; \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\] Consider the mid-point between \\(s\\) and \\(\\tilde{a}\\), that is, \\[\nm:=\\frac{s + \\tilde{a}}{2} \\in K \\,.\n\\] Since \\(m\\) is the mid-point between \\(s\\) and \\(\\tilde{a}\\), and \\(s &lt; \\tilde{a}\\), it holds \\[\ns &lt; m &lt; \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\] In particular the above tells us that \\(m\\) is not an upper bound for \\(A\\), given that \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\). Therefore \\(m \\in B^c\\). By (3.19) we then have \\[\nm \\leq s \\,,\n\\] which contradicts \\(s &lt; m\\). Therefore \\(s\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\).\nConclusion. We have shown that \\(s\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\). Condition\n(3.19) tells us that \\[\ns \\leq y \\,, \\,\\, \\forall y \\in B \\,.\n\\] Recalling that \\(B\\) is the set of upper bounds of \\(A\\), this means that \\(s\\) is the least upper bound of \\(A\\), that is, \\[\ns = \\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\]\nStep 2. Completeness \\(\\implies\\) Cut Property.\nSuppose \\(K\\) is complete. We need to show that \\(K\\) has the Cut Property. Therefore assume \\((A,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\), that is, \\[\nA \\neq \\emptyset\\,, \\quad B \\neq \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] \\[\nK = A \\cup B\\,, \\quad A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.20}\\] Since \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\), from (3.20) it follows that \\(A\\) is bounded above: just take any element \\(b \\in B\\) in estimate (3.20) to see it. Since \\(A \\neq \\emptyset\\), by Completeness we have \\[\ns = \\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\] In particular \\[\na \\leq s \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\] Let now \\(b \\in B\\) be arbitrary. From (3.20) we have that \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\tag{3.21}\\] Therefore \\(b\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\). Since \\(s = \\sup A\\), we have that \\(s\\) is the smallest upper bound, and so \\[\ns \\leq b \\,.\n\\] Given that \\(b \\in B\\) was arbitrary, it actually holds \\[\ns \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\,  b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.22}\\] From (3.21) and (3.22) we therefore have \\[\na \\leq s \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A \\,,  \\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(s\\) is a separator of \\((A,B)\\). Thus \\(K\\) has the Cut Property."

    "text": "4.1 Example: Heron’s Method\nThe first explicit algorithm for approximating \\[\n\\sqrt{x}\n\\] for \\(x &gt; 0\\) is known Heron’s method, after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron of Alexandria who described the method in his AD 60 work Metrica, see reference to Wikipedia page.\nLet us see what is the idea of the algorithm:\n\nSuppose that \\(a_1\\) is an approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from above, that is, \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_1 \\,.\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nMultiplying (4.1) by \\(\\sqrt{x}/a_1\\) we obtain \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} \\,,\n\\tag{4.2}\\] obtaining an approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from below.\nTherefore, putting together the above inequalities, \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} &lt; a_1\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nIf we take the average of the points \\(x/a_1\\) and \\(a_1\\), it is reasonable to think that we find a better approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Thus our next approximation is \\[\na_2 := \\frac{1}{2} \\left( a_1 + \\frac{x}{a_1} \\right) \\,,\n\\] see figure below.\n\n\n\n\nHeron’s Algorithm for approximating \\(\\sqrt{x}\\)\n\n\nIterating, we define by recurrence the sequence \\[\na_{n+1} := \\frac12  \\left( a_n + \\frac{x}{a_n} \\right)\n\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), where the initial guess \\(a_1\\) has to satisfy (4.1). The aim of the section is to show that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\ a_n = \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\tag{4.4}\\] We start by showing that (4.3) holds for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\n\nProposition 1We have \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_n} &lt; \\sqrt{x} &lt; a_n\n\\tag{4.5}\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\n\n\n\nProofWe prove it by induction:\n\nBy (4.1) and (4.2) we know that (4.5) holds for \\(n=1\\).\nSuppose now that (4.5) holds for \\(n\\). Then \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} & = \\frac12  \\left( a_n + \\frac{x}{a_n} \\right) - \\sqrt{x} \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n^2 + x - 2 a_n \\sqrt{x} ) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n - \\sqrt{x} )^2 &gt; 0 \\,,\n\\end{align}\\] since we are assuming that \\(a_n &gt; \\sqrt{x}\\). Therefore \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} \\,.\n\\tag{4.6}\\] Multiplying the above by \\(\\sqrt{x}/a_{n+1}\\) we get \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_{n+1}} &lt; \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\tag{4.7}\\] Inequalities (4.6) and (4.7) show that (4.5) holds for \\(n+1\\).\n\nTherefore we conclude (4.5) by the Principle of Induction.\n\n\nWe are now ready to prove error estimates, that is, estimating how far away \\(a_n\\) is from \\(\\sqrt{x}\\).\n\nProposition 2: Error estimateFor all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) we have \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac12 (a_{n} - \\sqrt{x}) \\,.\n\\tag{4.8}\\]\n\n\n\nProofBy Proposition 1 we know that \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_n} &lt; \\sqrt{x}\n\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+1} & = \\frac12 \\left(  a_n +  \\frac{x}{a_n}   \\right) \\\\\n        & &lt; \\frac12 \\left(  a_n +  \\sqrt{x}   \\right) \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] Subtracting \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from both members in the above inequality we get the thesis.\n\n\nInequality (4.8) is saying that the error halves at each step. Therefore we can prove that after \\(n\\) steps the error is exponentially lower, as detailed in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 3For all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) we have \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x})\n\\tag{4.9}\\]\n\n\n\nProofWe prove (4.9) by induction:\n\nFor \\(n=1\\) we have that (4.9) is satisfied, since it coincides with (4.8) for \\(n=1\\).\nSuppose that (4.9) holds for \\(n\\). By (4.8) with \\(n\\) replaced by \\(n+1\\) we have \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+2} - \\sqrt{x} & &lt; \\frac12 (a_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x}) \\\\\n& &lt; \\frac12 \\,\\cdot \\, \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_{1} - \\sqrt{x}) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} (a_{1} - \\sqrt{x})\n\\end{align}\\] where in the second inequality we used the induction hypothesis (4.9). Hence (4.9) holds for \\(n+1\\).\n\nBy invoking the Induction Principle we conclude the proof.\n\n\nLet us comment estimate (4.9). Denote the error at step \\(n\\) by \\[\ne_n := a_n - \\sqrt{x}\\,.\n\\] The initial error \\(e_1\\) depends on how far the initial guess is from \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). The estimate in (4.9) is telling us that \\(e_n\\) is a fraction of \\(e_1\\), and actually \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ e_n = 0\n\\] exponentially fast. From this fact we are finally able to prove (4.4).\n\nTheorem 4: Convergence of Heron’s AlgorithmWe have that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ a_n = \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofBy Proposition 3 we have that \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x})\n\\] Moreover Proposition 1 tells us that \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} \\,.\n\\] Putting together the two inequalities above we infer \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} + \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x}) \\,.\n\\tag{4.10}\\] Now note that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\frac{1}{2^n} =\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = 0 \\,.\n\\] Therefore the RHS of (4.10) converges to \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). Applying the Squeeze Theorem to (4.10) we conclude that \\(a_n \\to \\sqrt{x}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Coding the Algorithm\nHeron’s Algorithm can be easily coded in Python. For example, see the function below:\n# x is the number for which to compute sqrt(x)\n# guess is the point a_1\n# a_1 must be strictly larger than sqrt(x)\n# n is the number of iterations\n# the function returns a_{n+1}\n\ndef herons_algorithm(x, guess, n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2.0\n    return guess\nFor example let us use the Algorithm to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) after \\(3\\) iterations. For initial guess we take \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n# Calculate sqrt(2) with 3 iterations and guess 2\nsqrt_2 = herons_algorithm(2, 2, 3)\n\nprint(f\"The sqrt(2) is approximately {sqrt_2}\")\n\n\nThe sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142156862745097\n\n\nThat is a pretty good approximation in just \\(3\\) iterations!"
