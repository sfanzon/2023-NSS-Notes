    "text": "References\nWe will study curves and surfaces in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). I will follow mainly the textbook by Pressley [1]. Other references that inspired these notes are the books by do Carmo [2], O’Neill [3] and Bär [4].\nI will assume some knowledge from Analysis and Linear Algebra. A good place to revise these topics are the books by Zorich [5,6]. In addition, it can be helpful to plot curves and surfaces to aid visualization. I will do this with Python 3. I recommend installation through Anaconda or Miniconda. The actual coding can then be done through, for example, Jupyter Notebook. Good references for scientific Python programming are [7,8].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou are not expected to purchase any of the above books. These lecture notes will cover 100% of the topics you are expected to known in order to excel in the final exam.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] A.
