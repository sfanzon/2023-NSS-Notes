    "section": "1.1 Introduction",
    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe aim of this chapter is to rigorously introduce the set of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). But what do we mean by real numbers? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers) \\[\n\\mathbb{N}= \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,\\dots\\}\n\\] On this set we have a notion of sum of two numbers, denoted as usual by \\[\nn+m\n\\] for \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Here the symbol \\(\\in\\) denotes that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(3+7\\) results in \\(10\\).\n\nQuestionCan the sum be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nn+x = m \\,?\n\\]\n\n\nThe answer to the above question is clearly no. For example, take \\(n=10\\) and \\(m=1\\). Then \\(x = -9\\), which does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). We therefore need to extend the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) in order to invert the sum. This is done simply by introducing the set of integers \\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ -n,n \\, \\colon \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,,\n\\] that is, the set \\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ \\ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots \\} \\,.\n\\] The sum can be extended to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), by defining \\[\n(-n) + (-m) := - (m+n)\n\\tag{1.1}\\] for all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Now every element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) possesses an inverse, that is, for each \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), there exists \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), such that \\[\nn + m = 0 \\,.\n\\] What is \\(m\\) for a given \\(n\\)? Seeing the definition at (1.1), we simply have \\[\nm = - n \\,.\n\\] We can also multiply integers, in the usual way we learnt in school. For \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), we denote the multiplication by \\(nm\\).\n\nQuestionCan the multiplication in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\[\nnx = m \\,?\n\\]\n\n\nThe answer is of course no. Just take \\(n=2\\) and \\(m=1\\). The answer should be \\(1/2\\), but \\(1/2\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). Thus, in order to invert the multiplication, we need to extend the set of integers. This extension is called the set of rational numbers, defined by \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}:= \\left\\{ \\frac{m}{n} \\, \\colon \\, m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\, n \\neq 0    \\right\\} \\,.\n\\] In \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) the multiplication is invertible, and each non-zero element has an inverse: the inverse of \\(m/n\\) is given by \\(n/m\\). Moreover by construction \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\]\n\nQuestionHow can we draw the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)?\n\n\nIt is clear how to draw \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), as seen below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Representation of integers\n\n\nHowever \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is much denser than the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) represented in Figure 1.1. For example, consider \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nQuestionWhat is the number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) which is closest to \\(0\\)?\n\n\nThere is no right answer to the above question, since whichever rational number \\(m/n\\) you consider, we can always squeeze the rational number \\(m / (2n)\\) in between: \\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{m}{2n} &lt; \\frac{m}{n} \\,.\n\\] For example think about the case of the numbers \\(1/n\\) for \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(n \\neq 0\\). Such numbers get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\), as depicted below.\n\n\n\nFractions \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\)\n\n\nMaybe if we do the same reasoning with other progressively smaller rational numbers, we manage to fill out the interval \\([0,1]\\). In other words, we might conjecture the following.\n\nConjecture 1Maybe \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) can be represented by a continuous line.\n\n\nDo you think the above conjecture is true? If it was, mathematics would be quite boring. Indeed Conjecture 1 is false, as shown by the Theorem below.\n\nTheorem 2The number \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\nThe above theorem is the reason why \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is called an irrational number. For reference, a few digits of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are given by \\[\n\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048\\ldots\n\\] and the situation is as in the picture below.\n\n\n\nRepresenting \\(\\sqrt{2}\\)\n\n\nWe can therefore see that Conjecture 1 is false, and \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is not a line, given that it has a hole at \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Let us see why Theorem 2 is true.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 2We prove that \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by contradiction. This means assuming the existence of \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(q = \\sqrt{2}\\). In other words \\[\nq^2 = 2 \\,.\n\\tag{1.2}\\] We will show that (1.2) leads to a contradiction. Thus (1.2) must be false, and so \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\,,\n\\] concluding the thesis.\n\n\nSeeing the above, we might be tempted to just extend \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) to include \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). But then we also have \\(\\sqrt{p} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\) for each prime number \\(p\\). Then we might attempt \\[\n\\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} := \\mathbb{Q}\\cup \\{ \\sqrt{p} \\, \\colon \\, p \\, \\text{ prime} \\} \\,.\n\\] However even this is not enough, as we would have, for example \\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} , \\, \\pi , \\, \\pi + \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} \\,.\n\\] The reality of things is that to complete \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) and make it into a continuous line we have to add a lot of points. Indeed, we need to add way more points than the ones already contained in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Such extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) will be called \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the set of real numbers. The inclusions will be \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\] The set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is not at all trivial to construct. In fact, at first we will just assume its existence and study its properties. We will then provide a concrete model for the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), to prove once and for all that such set indeed exists."
