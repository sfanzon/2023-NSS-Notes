    "text": "The first aim of this lecture notes is to rigorously introduce the set of real numbers, which is denoted by \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). But what do we mean by real numbers? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers) \\[\n\\mathbb{N}= \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,\\dots\\}\n\\]\nOn this set we have a notion of sum of two numbers, denoted as usual by \\[\nn+m\n\\]\nfor \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Here the symbol \\(\\in\\) denotes that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(3+7\\) results in \\(10\\).\n\nQuestion 1Can the sum be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nn+x = m \\,?\n\\tag{1.1}\\]\n\n\nOf course to invert (1.1) we can just perform a subtraction, implying that\n\\[\nx = m - n \\,.\n\\]\nBut there is a catch. In general \\(x\\) does not need to be in \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). For example, take \\(n=10\\) and \\(m=1\\). Then \\(x = -9\\), which does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Therefore the answer to Question 1 is NO.\nTo make sure that we can always invert the sum, we need to extend the set \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). This is done simply by introducing the set of integers \\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ -n,n \\, \\colon \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,,\n\\]\nthat is, the set\n\\[\n\\mathbb{Z}:= \\{ \\ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\\ldots \\} \\,.\n\\]\nThe sum can be extended to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), by defining \\[\n(-n) + (-m) := - (m+n)\n\\tag{1.2}\\]\nfor all \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Now every element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) possesses an inverse, that is, for each \\(n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), there exists \\(m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), such that \\[\nn + m = 0 \\,.\n\\]\nCan we characterize \\(m\\) explicitly? Of course! Seeing the definition at (1.2), we simply have \\[\nm = - n \\,.\n\\]\nOn the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) we can also define the operation of multiplication, in the usual way we learnt in school. For \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), we denote the multiplication by \\(nm\\) or \\(n \\cdot m\\). For example \\(7 \\cdot 2 = 14\\) and \\(1 \\cdot (-1) = -1\\).\n\nQuestion 2Can the multiplication in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) be inverted? That is, given any \\(n,m \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), can you always find \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\[\nnx = m \\,?\n\\tag{1.3}\\]\n\n\nTo invert (1.3) if \\(n \\neq 0\\), we can just perform a division, to obtain \\[\nx = \\frac{m}{n} \\,.\n\\] But again there is a catch. Indeed taking \\(n=2\\) and \\(m=1\\) yields \\(x = 1/2\\), which does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). The answer to Question 2 is therefore NO.\nThus, in order to invert the multiplication, we need to extend the set of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). This extension is called the set of rational numbers, defined by \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}:= \\left\\{ \\frac{m}{n} \\, \\colon \\, m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, \\, n \\neq 0    \\right\\} \\,.\n\\] We then extend the operations of sum and multiplication to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) by defining \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} + \\frac{p}{q} := \\frac{mq + np}{nq}\n\\] and \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} \\, \\cdot \\, \\frac{p}{q} := \\frac{mp}{nq}\n\\] Now the multiplication is invertible in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Specifically, each non-zero element has an inverse: the inverse of \\(m/n\\) is given by \\(n/m\\).\nTo summarize, we have extended \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), and \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). By construction we have \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] Moreover sum and product are invertible in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Now we are happy right? So and so.\n\nQuestion 3Can we draw the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)?\n\n\nIt is clear how to draw \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), as seen below.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Representation of integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)\n\n\nHowever \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is much larger than the set \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) represented by the ticks in Figure 1.1. What do we mean by larger? For example, consider \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nQuestion 4What is the number \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) which is closest to \\(0\\)?\n\n\nThere is no right answer to the above question, since whichever rational number \\(m/n\\) you consider, you can always squeeze the rational number \\(m / (2n)\\) in between: \\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{m}{2n} &lt; \\frac{m}{n} \\,.\n\\] For example think about the case of the numbers \\[\n\\frac1n \\, \\text{ for } \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}, \\, n \\neq 0 \\,.\n\\] Such numbers get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\), as depicted below.\n\n\n\nFractions \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) can get arbitrarily close to \\(0\\)\n\n\nMaybe if we do the same reasoning with other progressively smaller rational numbers, we manage to fill out the interval \\([0,1]\\). In other words, we might conjecture the following.\n\nConjecture 5Maybe \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) can be represented by a continuous line.\n\n\nDo you think the above conjecture is true? If it was, mathematics would be quite boring. Indeed Conjecture 5 is false, as shown by the Theorem below.\n\nTheorem 6The number \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) does not belong to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\nTheorem 6 is the reason why \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is called an irrational number. For reference, a few digits of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) are given by \\[\n\\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048\\ldots\n\\] and the situation is as in the picture below.\n\n\n\nRepresenting \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) on the numbers line.\n\n\nWe can therefore see that Conjecture 5 is false, and \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is not a line: indeed \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a gap at \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). Let us see why Theorem 6 is true.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 6\nWe prove that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] by contradiction.\nWait, what does this mean? Proving the claim by contradiction means assuming that the claim is false. This means we assume that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\tag{1.4}\\] From this assumption we then start deducing other statements, hoping to encounter a statement which is FALSE. But if (1.4) leads to a false statement, then it must be that (1.4) is FALSE. Thus the contrary of (1.4) must hold, meaning that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] as we wanted to show. This would conclude the proof.\nNow we need to actually show that (1.4) will lead to a contradiction. Since this is our first proof, let us take it slowly, step-by-step.\n\nAssuming (1.4) just means that there exists \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\nq = \\sqrt{2} \\, .\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\nSince \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), by definition we have \\[\nq = \\frac{m}{n}\n\\] for some \\(m,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(n \\neq 0\\).\nRecalling (1.5), we then have \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\]\nWe can square the above equation to get \\[\n\\frac{m^2}{n^2} = 2 \\,.\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nWithouth loss of generality, we can assume that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have no common factors.\n\nWait. What does Step 5 mean? You will encounter the sentence withouth loss of generality many times in mathematics. It is often abbreviated in WLOG. WLOG means that the assumption that follows is chosen arbitrarily, but does not affect the validity of the proof in general.\nFor example in our case we can assume that \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) have no common factor. This is because if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) had common factors, then it would mean \\[\nm = a \\tilde{m} \\,, \\quad n = a \\tilde{n}\n\\] for some \\(a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) with \\(a \\neq 0\\). Then \\[\n\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{ a \\tilde{m} }{ a \\tilde{n} } =\n\\frac{ \\tilde{m} }{ \\tilde{n} } \\,.\n\\] Therefore by (1.6) \\[\n\\frac{ \\tilde{m}^2 }{ \\tilde{n}^2 } = 2 \\,.\n\\] The proof can now proceed in the same way we would have proceeded from Step 4, but in addition we have the hypothesis that \\(\\tilde{m}\\) and \\(\\tilde{n}\\) have no common factors.\n\nEquation (1.6) implies \\[\nm^2 = 2 n^2 \\,.\n\\tag{1.7}\\] Therefore the integer \\(m^2\\) is an even number.\n\nWhy is \\(m^2\\) even? As you already know, even numbers are \\[\n0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \\ldots\n\\] All these numbers have in common that they can be divided by \\(2\\), and so they can be written as \\[\n2 p\n\\] for some \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(52\\) is even, because \\[\n52 = 2 \\cdot 26 \\,.\n\\] Instead, odd numbers are \\[\n1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, \\ldots\n\\] These can be all written as \\[\n2p + 1\n\\] for some \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). For example \\(53\\) is odd, because \\[\n52 = 2 \\cdot 26 + 1 \\,.\n\\]\n\nThus \\(m\\) is an even number, and so there exists \\(p \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nm = 2p \\,.\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\nWhy is (1.8) true? Let us see what happens if we take the square of an even number \\(m = 2p\\) \\[\nm^2 = (2p)^2 = 4p^2 = 2 (2p^2) = 2 q \\,.\n\\] Thus \\(m^2 = 2 q\\) for some \\(q\\in \\mathbb{N}\\), and so \\(m^2\\) is an even number. If instead \\(m\\) is odd, then \\(m = 2p + 1\\) and \\[\nm^2 = (2p + 1 )^2 = 4p^2 + 4p + 1 = 2(2 p^2 + 2p) + 1\n\\] showing that also \\(m^2\\) is odd.\nThis justifies Step 7: Indeed we know that \\(m^2\\) is an even number from Step 6. If \\(m\\) was odd, then \\(m^2\\) would be odd. Hence \\(m\\) must be even as well.\n\nIf we substitute (1.8) in (1.7) we get \\[\nm^2 = 2n^2 \\, \\implies \\,  (2p)^2 = 2n^2 \\, \\implies \\,  4 p^2 = 2 n^2\n\\] Dividing both terms by \\(2\\), we obtain \\[\nn^2 = 2p^2\\,.\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\nWe now make a series of observations:\n\nEquation (1.9) says that \\(n^2\\) is even.\nStep 6 says that \\(m^2\\) is even.\nTherefore \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are also even.\n\nHence \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) have \\(2\\) as common factor.\nBut Step 5 says that \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) have no common factors.\nCONTRADICTION\n\nOur reasoning has run into a contradiction, starting from assumption (1.4), which says that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] Hence the above must be FALSE, and so \\[\n\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\,\n\\] ending the proof.\n\n\n\nSeeing that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), we might be tempted to just fill in the gap by adding \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) to \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). However, with analogous proof to Theorem 6, we can prove that \\[\n\\sqrt{p} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] for each prime number \\(p\\). As there are infinite prime numbers, this means that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has infinite gaps. Then we might attempt to fill in these gaps via the extension \\[\n\\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} := \\mathbb{Q}\\cup \\{ \\sqrt{p} \\, \\colon \\, p \\, \\text{ prime} \\} \\,.\n\\] However even this is not enough, as we would still have numbers which are not contained in \\(\\tilde{Q}\\), for example \\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} , \\, \\pi , \\, \\pi + \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\tilde{\\mathbb{Q}} \\,.\n\\]\n\nRemark 7Proving that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] is relatively easy, and will be left as an exercise. Instead, proving that \\[\n\\pi \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] is way more complicated. There are several proof of the fact, all requiring mathematics which is more advanced of the one presented in this course. For some proofs, see this Wikipedia page.\n\n\nThe reality of things is that to complete \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) and make it into a continuous line we have to add a lot of points. Indeed, we need to add way more points than the ones already contained in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Such extension of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) will be called \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), the set of real numbers. The inclusions will therefore be \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\mathbb{Z}\\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\] The set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is not at all trivial to construct. In fact, at first we will not construct it, but just do the following:\n\nWe will assume that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) exists and satisfies some basic axioms.\nOne of the axioms is that \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) fills all the gaps that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has. Therefore \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be thought as a continuous line.\nWe will study the properties of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) which descend from such axioms.\n\nFor example one of the properties of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) will be the following:\n\nTheorem 8: We will prove this in the future\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) contains all the square roots. This means that for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(x \\geq 0\\), we have \\[\n\\sqrt{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\]\n\n\nAt the end of this chapter we will provide a concrete model for the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), to prove once and for all that such set indeed exists.\n\nTheorem 9: We will prove this in the future\nThere exists a set \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), called the set of real numbers, which has the following properties:\n\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) extends \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), that is, \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}\\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\]\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) satisfies certain axioms.\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) fills all the gaps that \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has. In particular \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) can be represented by a continuous line."

However it is a good exercise in basic logic, so let us do it.\n\nFirst implication \\(\\implies\\):\nSuppose that \\(A=B\\). Let us show that \\(A\\subset B\\). Since \\(A = B\\), this means that all the elements of \\(A\\) are also contained in \\(B\\). Therefore if we take \\(x \\in A\\) we have \\[\nx \\in A \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, x \\in B \\,.\n\\] This shows \\(A \\subset B\\). The proof of \\(B \\subset A\\) is similar.\nSecond implication \\(\\impliedby\\):\nSuppose that \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset A\\). We need to show \\(A=B\\), that is, \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same elements. To this end let \\(x \\in A\\). Since \\(A \\subset B\\) then we have \\(x \\in B\\). Thus \\(B\\) contains all the elements of \\(A\\). Since we are also assuming \\(B \\subset A\\), this means that \\(A\\) contains all the elements of \\(B\\). Hence \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) contain the same elements, and \\(A=B\\).\n\n\n\nThe above proposition is very useful when we need to prove that two sets are equal: rather than showing directly that \\(A = B\\), we can prove that \\(A \\subset B\\) and \\(B \\subset A\\).\n\n\n2.3.3 Infinite unions and intersections\nSuppose given a set \\(\\Omega\\), and a family of sets \\(A_n \\subset \\Omega\\), where \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then we can define the infinte union \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in A_n \\,\\, \\text{ for at least one } \\,\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,.\n\\] The infinte intersection is defined as \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in A_n \\,\\, \\text{ for all } \\,\\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} \\,.\n\\]\n\nExample 8Let the ambient set be \\(\\Omega:=\\mathbb{N}\\) and define the family \\(A_n\\) by \\[\\begin{align}\nA_1 & := \\{ 1, 2, 3 , 4 , \\ldots \\} \\\\\nA_2 & := \\{ 2, 3 , 4 , 5, \\ldots \\} \\\\\nA_3 & := \\{ 3 , 4 , 5, 6, \\ldots \\} \\\\\n& \\ldots \\ldots  \\\\\nA_n & := \\{ n, n+1, n+2, n+3,  \\ldots \\} \\,,\n\\end{align}\\] for arbitrary \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n = \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\tag{2.2}\\] The above equality can be easily proven using Proposition 7. Indeed, assume that \\(m \\in \\cup_n A_n\\). Then \\(m \\in A_n\\) for at least one \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Since \\(A_n \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\), we conclude that \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). This shows \\[\n\\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\subset \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] Conversely, suppose that \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). By definition \\(m \\in A_m\\). Hence there exists at least one index \\(n\\), \\(n=m\\) in this case, such that \\(m \\in A_n\\). Then by definition \\(m \\in \\cup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n\\), showing that \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\subset \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\,.\n\\] Hence we conclude (2.2) by Proposition 7.\nWe also have that \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n = \\emptyset \\,.\n\\tag{2.3}\\] We prove the above by contradiction. Indeed, suppose that (2.3) is false, i.e., \\[\n\\bigcap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n \\neq \\emptyset \\,.\n\\] This means there exists some \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\(m \\in \\cap_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} A_n\\). Hence, by definition, \\(m \\in A_n\\) for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). However \\(m \\notin A_{m+1}\\), yielding a contradiction. Thus (2.3) holds.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Complement\nSuppose that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are subsets of a larger set \\(\\Omega\\). The complement of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(B\\) is the set of elements of \\(B\\) which do not belong to \\(A\\), that is \\[\nB \\smallsetminus A := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\in B \\, \\text{ and } \\, x \\notin A \\} \\,.\n\\] In particular, the complement of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(\\Omega\\) is denoted by \\[\nA^c := \\Omega \\smallsetminus A := \\{ x \\in \\Omega \\, \\colon \\, x \\notin A \\} \\,.\n\\]\n\nRemark 9Suppose that \\(A \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\(A\\) and \\(A^c\\) form a partition of \\(\\Omega\\), in the sense that \\[\nA \\cup A^c = \\Omega  \\,\\, \\text{ and } \\,\\,  A \\cap A^c = \\emptyset \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 10\nSuppose \\(A, B \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\[\nA \\subset B  \\iff B^c \\subset A^c \\,.\n\\]\nLet us prove the above claim:\n\nFirst implication \\(\\implies\\):\nSuppose that \\(A \\subset B\\). We need to show that \\(B^c \\subset A^c\\). Hence, assume \\(x \\in B^c\\). By definition this means that \\(x \\notin B\\). Now notice that we cannot have that \\(x \\in A\\). Indeed, assume \\(x \\in A\\). By assumption we have \\(A \\subset B\\), hence \\(x \\in B\\). But we had assumed \\(x \\in B\\), contradiction. Therefore it must be that \\(x \\notin A\\). Thus \\(B^c \\subset A^c\\).\nSecond implication \\(\\impliedby\\):\nEssentially the same proof, hence we omit it.\n\n\n\n\nWe conclude by stating the De Morgan’s Laws. The proof will be left as an exercise.\n\nProposition 11: De Morgan’s LawsSuppose \\(A,B \\subset \\Omega\\). Then \\[\n(A \\cap B)^c = A^c \\cup B^c\n\\] and \\[\n(A \\cup B)^c = A^c \\cap B^c  \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3.5 Power set\nLet \\(\\Omega\\) be an arbitray set. We define the power set of \\(\\Omega\\) as \\[\n\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) := \\{ A \\, \\colon \\,A \\subset \\Omega \\}\\,,\n\\] that is, the power set of \\(\\Omega\\) is the set of all subsets of \\(\\Omega\\).\n\nRemark 12\nIt holds that:\n\n\\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) is always non-empty, since we have that \\[\n\\emptyset \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\,,  \\quad  \\Omega \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\,.\n\\]\nGiven \\(A, B \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\), then the sets \\[\nA \\cup B, \\quad  A \\cap B ,\\quad A^c , \\quad B \\smallsetminus A\n\\] are all elements of \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\).\nSuppose \\(\\Omega\\) is discrete and finite, that is, \\[\n\\Omega = \\{x_1, \\ldots, x_m\\}\n\\] for some \\(m \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Then \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) contains \\(2^m\\) elements.\n\nThis is because for each \\(x_i \\in \\Omega\\) we have just two choices: either include \\(x_i\\) in a subset, or do not include \\(x_i\\) in a subset.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13Define the set \\[\n\\Omega = \\{ x, y, z \\}\\,.\n\\] Then \\(\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega)\\) has \\(2^3 = 8\\) elements. These are\n\n\\(\\emptyset\\)\n\\(\\{x\\}\\)\n\\(\\{y\\}\\)\n\\(\\{z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,y\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{y,z\\}\\)\n\\(\\{x,y,z\\}\\)\n\nWe therefore write \\[\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) = \\{ \\emptyset, & \\, \\{x\\} , \\,  \\{y\\} , \\, \\{z\\} , \\{x,y\\} \\\\\n&  \\{x,z\\}, \\, \\{y,z\\} , \\, \\{x,y,z\\} \\} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\n\n2.3.6 Product of sets\nSuppose \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two sets. The product of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the set of pairs \\[\nA \\times B := \\{ (a,b) \\, \\colon \\, a \\in A, \\, b \\in B \\} \\,.\n\\] By definition two elements in \\(A \\times B\\) are the same, in symbols \\[\n(a, b) = (\\tilde{a}, \\tilde{b})\n\\] if and only if they are equal component-by-componenent, that is \\[\na=\\tilde{a}\\,, \\qquad b = \\tilde{b} \\,.\n\\]"

The quotient space is then \\[\n\\mathbb{N}/ R = \\{ [x] \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{  \\{ x\\} \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}  \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExample 17Suppose that \\(R\\) is a binary relation on the set \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) of rational numbers defined by \\[\nx \\sim y  \\iff x-y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\,.\n\\] Then \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). Indeed:\n\nReflexive: Let \\(x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Then \\(x-x = 0\\) and \\(0 \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Thus \\(x \\sim x\\).\nSymmetric: If \\(x \\sim y\\) then \\(x-y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). But then also\n\\[\n-(x-y) = y - x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\] and so \\(y \\sim x\\).\nTransitive: Suppose \\(x \\sim y\\) and \\(y \\sim z\\).

This shows that \\(R\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\nNow note that \\[\ny \\sim x \\iff y -x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n\\] and the above is equivalent to \\[\n\\exists \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, y - x = n\n\\] which again is equivalent to \\[\n\\exists \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, y = x + n \\,.\n\\] Therefore all the elements of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) related to \\(x\\) by \\(R\\) are of the form \\[\nx + n \\,, \\, \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\,.\n\\] The equivalence classes with respect to \\(R\\) are then \\[\n[x] = \\{  x + n \\ \\colon \\ n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}  \\,.\n\\] Each equivalence class has exactly one element in \\([0,1) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\), meaning that: \\[\n\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\,\\, \\exists! \\, q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, 0 \\leq q &lt; 1 \\, \\text{ and } \\, q \\in [x]\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\mathbb{Q}/ R = \\{ [x] \\, \\colon \\,x \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\} = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,0 \\leq q &lt;1  \\} \\,.\n\\]"

It is a very important inequality, which we will use a lot in the future.\n\nTheorem 35: Triangle inequalityFor every \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) we have \\[\n| |x| - |y| | \\leq |x+y| \\leq |x| + |y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\n\n\nBefore proceeding with the proof, let us discuss the geometric meaning of the triangle inequality.\n\nRemark 36: Geometric meaning of triangle inequalityThe notion of absolute value can be extended also to vectors in the plane. Suppose that \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are two vectors in the plane, as in Figure 2.8 below. Then \\(|x|\\) and \\(|y|\\) can be interpreted as the lengths of these vectors.\nUsing the rule of sum of vectors, we can draw \\(x+y\\), as shown in Figure 2.9 below.

We prove the two inequalities in (2.7) individually.\nStep 1. Proof of the second inequality in (2.7).\nTrivially we have \\[\n|x| \\leq |x| \\,.\n\\] Therefore we can apply Lemma 33 and infer \\[\n-|x| \\leq x \\leq |x| \\,.\n\\tag{2.9}\\] Similarly we have that \\(|y| \\leq |y|\\), and so Lemma 33 implies \\[\n-|y| \\leq y \\leq |y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.10}\\] Summing (2.9) and (2.10) we get \\[\n-(|x| + |y|) \\leq x + y \\leq |x| + |y| \\,.\n\\] We can now again apply Lemma 33 to get \\[\n|x + y| \\leq |x| + |y| \\,,\n\\tag{2.11}\\] which is the second inequality in (2.7).\nStep 2. Proof of the first inequality in (2.7).\nNote that the trivial identity \\[\nx = x+y - y\n\\] always holds. We then have \\[\\begin{align}\n|x| & = |x+y - y| \\\\\n    & = |(x+y) + (-y)| \\\\\n    & = |a+b|\n\\end{align}\\] with \\(a=x+y\\) and \\(b=-y\\). We can now apply (2.11) to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to obtain \\[\\begin{align}\n|x| & = |a+b| \\\\\n    & \\leq |a| + |b| \\\\\n    & = |x+y| + |-y| \\\\\n    & = |x+y| + |y|\n\\end{align}\\] Therefore \\[\n|x| - |y| \\leq |x+y| \\,.\n\\tag{2.12}\\] We can now swap \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in (2.12) to get \\[\n|y| - |x| \\leq |x+y| \\,.\n\\] By rearranging the above inequality we obtain \\[\n-|x+y| \\leq |x| - |y|  \\,.\n\\tag{2.13}\\] Putting together (2.12) and (2.13) yields \\[\n-|x+y| \\leq |x| - |y| \\leq |x+y| \\,.  \n\\] By Lemma 33 the above is equivalent to \\[\n||x| - |y|| \\leq |x+y| \\,,\n\\] which is the first inequality in (2.7).\n\n\nAn immediate consequence of the triangle inequality are the following inequalities, which are left as an exercise.\n\nRemark 37For any \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) it holds \\[\n||x|-|y|| \\leq |x-y| \\leq |x|+|y|\\,.\n\\] Moreover for any \\(x,y,z \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) it holds \\[\n|x-y| \\leq |x-z| + |z-y| \\,.\n\\]"

Common strategies to prove (2.14) are:\n\nContradiction: Assume that the thesis is false, and hope to reach a contradiction: that is, prove that \\[\n\\neg \\beta \\implies \\, \\mbox{ contradiction}\n\\] where \\(\\neg \\beta\\) is the negation of \\(\\beta\\).\n\nFor example we already proved by contradiction that \\[\n\\mbox{Definition of } \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\implies \\, \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\,,\n\\] In the above statement \\[\n\\alpha = \\left( \\mbox{Definition of } \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\] \\[\n\\beta = \\left( \\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\n\\neg \\beta  = \\left(  \\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\right) \\,.\n\\]\n\nDirect: Sometimes proofs will also need direct arguments, meaning that one need to show directly that (2.14) holds.\nContrapositive: The statement (2.14) is equivalent to \\[\n\\neg \\beta \\, \\implies \\, \\neg \\alpha \\,.\n\\tag{2.15}\\] Thus, instead of proving (2.14), one could show (2.15). The statement (2.15) is called the contrapositive of (2.14).\n\nLet us make an example.\n\nProposition 38Two real numbers \\(a,b\\) are equal if and only if for every real number \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) it follows that \\(|a-b|&lt;\\varepsilon\\).\n\n\nBefore proceeding with the proof, note that the above stetement is just saying that:\n\nTwo numbers are equal if and only if they are arbitrarily close\n\nBy arbitrarily close we mean that they are as close as you want the to be.\n\nProof: of Proposition 38Let us first rephrase the statement using mathematical symbols:\n\nLet \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\).

Proof that \\(\\alpha \\implies \\beta\\).\nThis proof can be carried out by a direct argument. Since we are assuming \\(\\alpha\\), this means \\[\na=b \\,.\n\\] We want to see that \\(\\beta\\) holds. Therefore fix an arbitrary \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\). This means that \\(\\varepsilon\\) can be any positive number, as long as you fix it. Clearly \\[\n|a-b| = |0| = 0 &lt; \\varepsilon\n\\] since \\(a=b\\), \\(|0|=0\\), and \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\). The above shows that \\[\n|a-b| &lt; \\varepsilon\\,.\n\\] As \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) was arbitrary, we have just proven that \\[\n|a-b| &lt; \\varepsilon\\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, \\varepsilon&gt;0 \\,,\n\\] meaning that \\(\\beta\\) holds and the proof is concluded.\nStep 2. Proof that \\(\\beta \\implies \\alpha\\).\nLet us prove this implication by showing the contrapositive \\[\n\\neg \\alpha \\implies \\neg\\beta \\,.\n\\] So let us assume \\(\\neg \\alpha\\) is true. This means that \\[\na \\neq b \\,.\n\\] We have to see that \\(\\neg \\beta\\) holds. But \\(\\neg \\beta\\) means that \\[\n\\exists \\, \\varepsilon_0&gt; 0 \\, \\text{ s.t. } \\, |a-b| \\geq \\varepsilon_0 \\,.\n\\] The above is satisfied by choosing \\[\n\\varepsilon_0 := |a-b| \\,,\n\\] since \\(\\varepsilon_0 &gt;0\\) given that \\(a \\neq b\\)."

This means that something which looks elementary needs to be assumed to hold, in order to have a starting point for proving deeper statements.\nIn the case of the Principle of Induction, the intuition is clear:\n\nThe Principle of Induction is just describing the domino effect: If one tile falls, then the next one will fall as well. Therefore if the first tile falls, all the tiles will fall.\n\nIt seems reasonable to assume such evident principle.\n\n\nThe Principle of Induction can be used to prove statements which depend on some index \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).

Note that we could not have defined \\[\n1 + 1  = 2\\,,\n\\] since \\(2 \\notin K\\).\n\n\nBinary operations take ordered pairs of elements of \\(K\\) as input.

Indeed we have already shown in Example 5 that:\n\n(A1) and (M1) hold,\n(A2) holds with neutral element \\(0\\),\n(M2) holds with neutral element \\(1\\),\n(A3) every element has an additive inverse, with \\[\n-0 = 0 \\,, \\quad - 1 = 1 \\,,\n\\]\n(M3) every element which is not \\(0\\) a multiplicative inverse, with \\[\n1^{-1} = 1\\,.\n\\]\n\nWe are left to show the Distributive Property (AM). Indeed:\n\n(AM) For all \\(y,z \\in K\\) we have \\[\n0 \\cdot (y + z) = 0 \\,, \\quad (0 \\cdot y) + (0 \\cdot z) = 0 + 0 = 0\\,,\n\\] and also \\[\n1 \\cdot (y + z) = y + z \\,, \\quad (1 \\cdot y) + (1 \\cdot z) = y + z \\,.\n\\] Thus (AM) holds.\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 9: Subtraction and division\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. We define:\n\nSubtraction as the operation \\(-\\) defined by \\[\nx - y := x + (-y) \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x , y \\in K \\,,\n\\] where \\(-y\\) is the additive inverse of \\(y\\).\nDivision as the operation \\(/\\) defined by \\[\nx/y := x \\cdot y^{-1}\\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x , y \\in K \\,, \\,\\, y \\neq 0 \\,,\n\\] where \\(y^{-1}\\) is the multiplicative inverse of \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\nProposition 10: Uniqueness of neutral elements and inverses\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. Then\n\nThere is a unique element in \\(K\\) with the property of \\(0\\),\nThere is a unique element in \\(K\\) with the property of \\(1\\),\nFor all \\(x \\in K\\) there is a unique additive inverse \\(-x\\),\nFor all \\(x \\in K\\), \\(x \\neq 0\\), there is a unique multiplicative inverse \\(x^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\nProof\n\nSuppose that \\(0 \\in K\\) and \\(\\tilde{0} \\in K\\) are both neutral element of \\(+\\), that is, they both satisfy (A2). Then \\[\n0 + \\tilde{0} = 0\n\\] since \\(\\tilde{0}\\) is a neutral element for \\(+\\). Moreover \\[\n\\tilde{0} + 0 = \\tilde{0}\n\\] since \\(0\\) is a neutral element for \\(+\\). By commutativity of \\(+\\), see property (A1), we have \\[\n0 = 0 + \\tilde{0} = \\tilde{0} + 0 = \\tilde{0} \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(0 = \\tilde{0}\\). Hence the neutral element for \\(+\\) is unique.\nExercise.\nLet \\(x \\in K\\) and suppose that \\(y, \\tilde{y} \\in K\\) are both additive inverses of \\(x\\), that is, they both satisfy (A3). Therefore \\[\nx + y = 0\n\\] since \\(y\\) is an additive inverse of \\(x\\) and \\[\nx + \\tilde{y} = 0\n\\] since \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is an additive inverse of \\(x\\). Therefore we can use commutativity and associativity and of \\(+\\), see property (A1), and the fact that \\(0\\) is the neutral element of \\(+\\), to infer \\[\\begin{align}\ny & = y + 0 = y + (x + \\tilde{y}) \\\\\n  & = (y + x) + \\tilde{y} = (x + y) + \\tilde{y} \\\\\n  & = 0 + \\tilde{y} = \\tilde{y} \\,,    \n\\end{align}\\] concluding that \\(y = \\tilde{y}\\). Thus there is a unique additive inverse of \\(x\\), and \\[\ny = \\tilde{y} = -x \\,,\n\\] with \\(-x\\) the element from property (A3).\nExercise.\n\n\n\nUsing the properties of field we can also show that the usual properties of sum, subtraction, multiplication and division still hold in any field. We list such properties in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 11: Properties of field operations\nLet \\((K,+,\\cdot)\\) be a field. Then for all \\(x,y,z \\in K\\),\n\n\\(x + y = x + z \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, y = z\\)\n\\(x \\cdot y = x \\cdot z \\,\\) and \\(\\,x \\neq 0 \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, y = z\\)\n\\(- 0 = 0\\)\n\\(1^{-1} = 1\\)\n\\(x \\cdot 0 = 0\\)\n\\(-1 \\cdot x = -x\\)\n\\(-(-x) = x\\)\n\\((x^{-1})^{-1} = x \\,\\) if \\(\\, x \\neq 0\\)\n\\((x \\cdot y)^{-1} = x^{-1} \\cdot y^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\nThe above properties can be all proven with elementary use of the field properties (A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3) and (AM). This is an exercise in patience, and is left to the reader.\nLet us conclude with examining the sets of numbers introduced in Chapter 1.\n\nTheorem 12\nConsider the sets \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) with the usual operations \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\).

Thus it is only missing (M3), the multiplicative inverse property.\n\\((\\mathbb{Q}, + , \\cdot)\\) is a field.\n\n\n\nThe proof is omitted."

For example the pair \\[\nA =  (-\\infty,\\sqrt{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\quad B = (\\sqrt{2},\\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\tag{3.1}\\] is a cut of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), since \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\).

More explicitly, there exist a cut \\((A,B)\\) of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) which has no separator.\n\n\n\nRemark 21Before proceeding with the proof, let us summarize the ideas behind it:\nWe will consider the cut \\((A,B)\\) in (3.1). We then assume by contradiction that \\((A,B)\\) admits a separator \\(L \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\), so that \\[\na \\leq L \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, a \\in A\\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.2}\\] Since \\((A,B)\\) is a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), then either \\(L \\in A\\) or \\(L \\in B\\). These will both lead to a contradiction:\n\nIf \\(L \\in A\\), then by definition we will have \\[\nL &lt; \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\] Now the idea is that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), and hence we can always find some \\(\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\nL &lt; \\tilde{L} &lt; \\sqrt{2} \\,.\n\\tag{3.3}\\] Therefore \\(\\tilde{L} \\in A\\), and (3.2) implies \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\leq L \\,,\n\\] which contradicts (3.3).\nIf \\(L \\in B\\), then by definition we will have \\[\n\\sqrt{2} &lt; L \\,.\n\\] Similarly, as \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), we can find \\(\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\[\n\\sqrt{2} &lt; \\tilde{L} &lt; L \\,.\n\\] Arguing as above we find a contradiction.\n\nTherefore both \\(L \\in A\\) and \\(L \\in B\\) lead to a contradiction. We conclude that \\((A,B)\\) has no separator in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\).\n\n\nTime to make the ideas in the above remark rigorous.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 20Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be the sets defined in (3.1). It is useful to rewrite \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in the form \\[\nA = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\,,\n\\] where \\[\nA_1 = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q&lt; 0  \\}\\,,\n\\] \\[\nA_2 =\\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q \\geq 0\\,, \\,\\, q^2 &lt; 2  \\} \\,,\n\\] and \\[\nB = \\{ q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\colon \\,q &gt; 0, \\,\\, q^2 &gt; 2  \\} \\,.\n\\]\nStep 1. \\((A,B)\\) is a cut of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\):\nWe need to prove the following:\n\n\\((A,B)\\) is a partition of \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). This is because \\(A , B \\subset \\mathbb{Q}\\) with \\(A \\neq \\emptyset\\) and \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\). Moreover \\(A \\cap B = \\emptyset\\) and \\[\nA \\cup B = \\mathbb{Q}\\,,\n\\] given that \\(\\sqrt{2} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}\\), and so there is no element \\(q \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) such that \\(q^2 = 2\\).\nIt holds \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\] Indeed, suppose that \\(a \\in A\\) and \\(b \\in B\\). We have two cases:\n\n\\(a \\in A_1\\): Therefore \\(a&lt;0\\). In particular \\[\na &lt; 0 &lt; b\\,,\n\\] given that \\(b &gt; 0\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\). Thus \\(a&lt;b\\).\n\\(a \\in A_2\\): Therefore \\(a \\geq 0\\) and \\(a^2 &lt; 2\\). In particular \\[\na^2 &lt; 2 &lt; b^2 \\,,\n\\] since \\(b^2&gt;2\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\). In particular \\[\na^2 &lt; b^2 \\,.\n\\] Since \\(b&gt;0\\) for all \\(b \\in B\\), from the above inequality we infer \\(a&lt;b\\), concluding.\n\n\nStep 2. \\((A,B)\\) has no separator:\nSuppose by contradiction that \\((A,B)\\) admits a separator \\[\nL \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] By definition this means \\[\na \\leq L \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.4}\\] Since \\[\nL \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\quad \\mathbb{Q}= A \\cup B \\,, \\quad  A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] then either \\(L \\in A\\) or \\(L \\in B\\). We will see that both these possibilities lead to a contradiction:\nCase 1: \\(L \\in A\\).\nBy (3.4) we know that \\[\na \\leq L \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\tag{3.5}\\] In particular the above implies \\[\nL \\geq 0\n\\tag{3.6}\\] since \\(0 \\in A\\). Therefore we must have \\(L \\in A_2\\), that is, \\[\nL \\geq 0 \\,\\, \\mbox{ and } \\,\\, L^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.7}\\] Set \\[\n\\tilde{L} := L + \\frac1n\n\\] for \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(n \\neq 0\\) to be chosen later. Clearly we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,\\,\\, \\mbox{ and } \\,\\,\\, L &lt; \\tilde{L}  \\,.\n\\tag{3.8}\\] From (3.6) and (3.8) we have also \\[\n\\tilde{L}&gt;0 \\,.\n\\tag{3.9}\\] We now want to show that there is a choice of \\(n\\) such that \\(\\tilde{L}^2 &lt; 2\\), which will lead to a contradiction. Indeed, we can estimate \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{L}^2 & = \\left( L + \\frac1n \\right)^2 \\\\\n            & = L^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \\frac{L}{n} \\\\\n            & &lt; L^2 + \\frac{1}{n} + 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n}&lt;\\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n            & = L^2 + \\frac{2L + 1}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] If we now impose that \\[\nL^2 + \\frac{2L + 1}{n} &lt; 2 \\,,\n\\] we can rearrange the above and obtain \\[\nn(2 - L^2) &gt; 2L + 1 \\,.\n\\] Now note that \\(L^2 &lt; 2\\) by assumption (3.7). Thus we can divived by \\((2 - L^2)\\) and obtain \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2} \\,.\n\\] Therefore we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2}  \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, \\tilde{L}^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\] Together with (3.9) this implies \\(\\tilde{L} \\in A\\). Therefore we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\leq L\n\\] by (3.5). On the other hand it also holds \\[\n\\tilde{L} &gt; L\n\\] by (3.8), and therefore we have a contradiction. Thus \\(L \\notin A\\).\nCase 2: \\(L \\in B\\).\nAs \\(L \\in B\\), we have by definition \\[\nL &gt; 0 \\,, \\quad L^2 &gt; 2 \\,.\n\\tag{3.10}\\] Moreover since \\(L\\) is a separator, see (3.4), in particular \\[\nL \\leq b \\,,  \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.11}\\] Define now \\[\n\\tilde{L} := L - \\frac1n\n\\] with \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), \\(n \\neq 0\\) to be chosen later. Clearly we have \\[\n\\tilde{L} \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\,, \\quad \\tilde{L} &lt; L \\,.\n\\tag{3.12}\\] We now show that \\(n\\) can be chosen so that \\(\\tilde{L} \\in B\\). Indeed \\[\\begin{align}\n\\tilde{L}^2  & = \\left(  L - \\frac1n   \\right)^2 \\\\\n             & = L^2 + \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{L}{n} \\\\\n             & &gt; L^2 - \\frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, \\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n^2}  \\right) \\\\\n             & &gt; L^2 - \\frac{1}{n} - 2 \\frac{L}{n}   \\qquad  \\left(\\mbox{using } \\, -\\frac{1}{n^2} &gt; - \\frac{1}{n}  \\right) \\\\\n             & = L^2 - \\frac{1 + 2L}{n} \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] Now we impose \\[\nL^2 - \\frac{1 + 2L}{n} &gt; 2\n\\] which is equivalent to \\[\nn(L^2 - 2) &gt; 1 + 2L \\,.\n\\] Since we are assuming \\(L \\in B\\), then \\(L^2 &gt; 2\\), see (3.10). Therefore we can divide by \\((L^2 -2)\\) and get \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \\,.\n\\] In total, we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt; \\frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tilde{L}^2 &gt; 2\\,,\n\\] proving that \\(\\tilde{L} \\in B\\). Therefore by (3.11) we get \\[\nL \\leq \\tilde{L} \\,.\n\\] This contradicts (3.12).\nConclusion:\nWe have seen that assuming that \\((A,B)\\) has a separator \\(L \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) leads to a contradiction. Thus the cut \\((A,B)\\) has no separator.\n\n\n\nRemark 22The above proof can be summarized by saying that the set \\[\nA = (-\\infty, \\sqrt{2}) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] does not admit a largest element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), and that the set \\[\nB = (\\sqrt{2}, \\infty) \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\n\\] does not admit a lowest element in \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\). We will clarify this remark in the next section."

Thus we can divide by \\((2 - s^2)\\) and obtain \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2} \\,.\n\\] To summarize, we have just shown that \\[\nn &gt;\\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2}  \\,\\, \\implies \\,\\, \\tilde{s}^2 &lt; 2 \\,.\n\\] Moreover \\(\\tilde{s} := (s + 1/n) \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\).

A set bounded below for which the infimum does nor exist is, for example, \\[\nA = (\\sqrt{2}, 10] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}\\,.\n\\] The proof of this fact is, of course, very similar to the one of Theorem 36, and is therefore omitted.\nThus infimum and supremum do not exist in general.

Cut Property \\(\\implies\\) Completeness. Suppose \\(K\\) has the Cut Property. To prove that \\(K\\) is Complete, we need to:\n\nConsider an arbitrary set \\(A \\subset K\\) such that \\(A \\neq \\emptyset\\) and \\(A\\) is bounded above.\nShow that \\(A\\) has a supremum.\n\nTo achieve this, consider the set \\[\nB := \\{ b \\in K \\, \\colon \\,b \\geq a \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A \\} \\,,\n\\] which is the set of Upper Bounds of \\(A\\).

Completeness \\(\\implies\\) Cut Property. Conversely, suppose that \\(K\\) is Complete. To prove that \\(K\\) has the Cut Property, we need to:\n\nConsider a cut \\((A,B)\\) of \\(K\\).\nShow that \\((A,B)\\) has a separator \\(s \\in K\\).\n\nThis implication is easier. Indeed, since \\(A\\) is non-empty and bounded above, by Completeness there exists \\[\n\\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\] We will show that \\[\ns := \\sup A\n\\] is a separator for the cut \\((A,B)\\). See Figure 3.2 for a schematic picture of the above construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Let \\(s\\) be the separator of the cut \\((B^c,B)\\), with \\(B\\) the set of upper bounds of \\(A\\).

Then \\(s\\) is the separator of the cut \\((A,B)\\).\n\n\nKeeping the above ideas in mind, let us proceed with the proof.\n\nProof: Proof of Theorem 41Step 1. Cut Property \\(\\implies\\) Completeness.\nWe need to prove that \\(K\\) is complete. To this end, consider \\(A \\subset K\\) non-empty and bounded above. Define the set of upper bounds of \\(A\\): \\[\nB := \\{ b \\in K \\, \\colon \\,b \\geq a \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A \\} \\,.\n\\]\nClaim. The pair \\((B^c,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\).\nProof of Claim. We have to prove two points:\n\n\\((B^c,B)\\) forms a partition of \\(K\\).\n\n\nIndeed, we have \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\), since \\(A\\) is bounded above. Further, we have \\(B^c \\neq \\emptyset\\), since \\(A\\) is non-empty. Thus \\[\nK = B^c \\cup B \\,, \\quad B^c \\cap B =  \\emptyset \\,.\n\\] Then \\((B^c,B)\\) is a partition of \\(K\\).\n\n\nWe have \\[\nx \\leq y \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in B^c\\,, \\,\\forall \\, y \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.18}\\]\n\n\nTo show the above, let \\(x \\in B^c\\) and \\(y \\in B\\). By definition of \\(B\\) we have that elements of \\(B^c\\) are not upper bounds of \\(A\\). Therefore \\(x\\) is not an upper bound. This means there exists \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\) which is larger than \\(x\\), that is, \\[\nx \\leq \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\] Since \\(y \\in B\\), then \\(y\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\), so that \\[\na \\leq y \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\[\nx \\leq \\tilde{a} \\leq y \\,,\n\\] concluding (3.18).\n\nThus \\((B^c,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\) and the claim is proven.\nSince \\((B^c,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\), by the Cut Property there exists a separator \\(s \\in K\\) such that \\[\nx \\leq s \\leq y \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in B^c\\,, \\,\\forall \\, y \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.19}\\]\nClaim. \\(s\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\).\nProof of Claim.\nSuppose by contradiction that \\(s\\) is not an upper bound for \\(A\\). Therefore by definition of upper bound, there exists \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\) such that \\[\ns &lt; \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\] Consider the mid-point between \\(s\\) and \\(\\tilde{a}\\), that is, \\[\nm:=\\frac{s + \\tilde{a}}{2} \\in K \\,.\n\\] Since \\(m\\) is the mid-point between \\(s\\) and \\(\\tilde{a}\\), and \\(s &lt; \\tilde{a}\\), it holds \\[\ns &lt; m &lt; \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\]\n\nIndeed, since \\(s &lt; \\tilde{a}\\) then \\[\ns = \\frac{2s}{2} &lt; \\frac{s + \\tilde{a}}{2} &lt; \\frac{2 \\tilde{a}}{2} = \\tilde{a} \\,.\n\\]\n\nIn particular the above tells us that \\(m\\) is not an upper bound for \\(A\\), given that \\(\\tilde{a} \\in A\\) and \\(m &lt; \\tilde{a}\\). Therefore \\(m \\in B^c\\), by definition of \\(B^c\\). Therefore(3.19) implies \\[\nm \\leq s \\,,\n\\] which contradicts \\(s &lt; m\\). Hence \\(s\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\), concluding the proof of Claim.\nConclusion. We have shown that \\(s\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\). Condition\n(3.19) tells us that \\[\ns \\leq y \\,, \\,\\, \\forall y \\in B \\,.\n\\] Recalling that \\(B\\) is the set of upper bounds of \\(A\\), this means that \\(s\\) is the smallest upper bound of \\(A\\), that is, \\[\ns = \\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\]\nStep 2. Completeness \\(\\implies\\) Cut Property.\nSuppose \\(K\\) is complete. We need to show that \\(K\\) has the Cut Property. Therefore assume \\((A,B)\\) is a cut of \\(K\\), that is, \\[\nA \\neq \\emptyset\\,, \\quad B \\neq \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] \\[\nK = A \\cup B\\,, \\quad A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\,,\n\\] \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\quad \\forall a \\in A \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.20}\\] Since \\(B \\neq \\emptyset\\), from (3.20) it follows that \\(A\\) is bounded above: indeed, every element of \\(B\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\), thanks to (3.20). Since \\(A \\neq \\emptyset\\), by the Axiom of Completeness we have \\[\ns = \\sup A \\in K \\,.\n\\] In particular, by definition of supremum, we have \\[\na \\leq s \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\] Let now \\(b \\in B\\) be arbitrary. From (3.20) we have that \\[\na \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\, a \\in A \\,.\n\\tag{3.21}\\] Therefore \\(b\\) is an upper bound of \\(A\\). Since \\(s = \\sup A\\), we have that \\(s\\) is the smallest upper bound, and so \\[\ns \\leq b \\,.\n\\] Given that \\(b \\in B\\) was arbitrary, it actually holds \\[\ns \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall \\,  b \\in B \\,.\n\\tag{3.22}\\] From (3.21) and (3.22) we therefore have \\[\na \\leq s \\leq b \\,, \\,\\, \\forall a \\in A \\,,  \\, \\forall \\, b \\in B \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(s\\) is a separator of \\((A,B)\\). Thus \\(K\\) has the Cut Property."

    "text": "4.1 Special subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)\nWe have defined \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) as a complete ordered field. This was done axiomatically and in a non constructive way. What happens now to the sets \\(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Q}\\)? Are they well defined? Does it still hold that \\[\n\\mathbb{N}\\,, \\mathbb{Z}\\,, \\mathbb{Q}\\, \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\,?\n\\] The definitions that we gave in Chapter 1 for \\(\\mathbb{N}, \\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) are not related to the system of real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) we just introduced. To overcome this problem, we will have to define new sets \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}, \\,\\, {\\mathbb{Z}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\,, \\,\\, {\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\] from scracth, starting from the axioms of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We are using a new font to distinguish these new sets from the old ones.\nLet us start with the definition of \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). We have the intuition that \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) should be \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} = \\{ \\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{2} , \\mathbf{3} , \\ldots \\} \\,.\n\\] Note that we are denoting the above numbers with bold symbols in order to distinguish them from the elements of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The key property that we would like \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) to have is the following: \\[\n\\mbox{Every } \\mathbf{n} \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}  \\, \\mbox{ has a successor } \\, (\\mathbf{n+1}) \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,.\n\\] How do we ensure this property? We could start by defining \\[\n\\mathbf{1}:=1\\,,\n\\] with \\(1\\) the neutral element of the multiplication in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which exists by the field axiom (M2). We could then define \\(\\mathbf{2}\\) by setting \\[\n\\mathbf{2} := 1 + 1 \\,.\n\\] We need a formal definition to capture this idea. This is the concept of inductive set.\n\nDefinition 1: Inductive set\nLet \\(S \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\). We say that \\(S\\) is an inductive set if they are satisfied:\n\n\\(1 \\in S\\),\nIf \\(x \\in S\\), then \\((x + 1) \\in S\\).\n\n\n\nNote that in the above definition we just used:\n\nThe existence of the neutral element \\(1\\), given by axiom (M2).\nThe operation of sum in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), which is again given as an axiom.\n\n\nExample 2\nWe have that\n\n\\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is an inductive set.\n\n\nIndeed we have \\(1 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) by axiom (M2). Moreover \\((x + 1) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) for every \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\), by definition of sum \\(+\\).\n\n\nThe set \\(A=\\{0,1\\}\\) is not an inductive set.\n\n\nThis is because \\(1 \\in A\\), but \\((1 + 1) \\notin A\\), since \\(1 + 1 \\neq 0\\).\n\n\n\nTherefore \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is an inductive set, showing that the definition of inductive set is not sufficient to fully describe our intuitive idea of \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). The right way to define \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is as follows: \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mbox{ is the smallest inductive subset of } \\mathbb{R}\\,.\n\\] To make the above definition formal we need a few observations.\n\nProposition 3Let \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) be a collection of inductive subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\[\nS := \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\, M\n\\] is an inductive subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\nProofWe have to show that the two properties of inductive sets hold for \\(S\\):\n\nWe have \\(1 \\in M\\) for every \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), since these are inductive sets. Thus \\[\n1 \\in \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\, M  = S \\,.\n\\]\nSuppose that \\(x \\in S\\). By definition of \\(S\\) this implies that \\(x \\in M\\) for all \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\). Since \\(M\\) is an inductive set, then \\((x + 1) \\in M\\). Therefore \\((x+1) \\in M\\) for all \\(M \\in \\mathcal{M}\\), showing that \\((x+1) \\in S\\).\n\nTherefore \\(S\\) is an inductive set.\n\n\nWe are now ready to define the natural numbers \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\).\n\nDefinition 4: Set of Natural NumbersLet \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) be the collection of all inductive subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We define the set of natural numbers in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) as \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} := \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} \\, M \\,.\n\\]\n\n\nTherefore \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is the intersection of all the inductive subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). From this definition it follows that \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is the smallest inductive subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), as shown in the following theorem.\n\nTheorem 5: \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is the smallest inductive subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)Let \\(C \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) be an inductive subset. Then \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\subset C \\,.\n\\] In other words, \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is the smallest inductive set in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\n\n\nProofLet \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) be the collection of all inductive subsets of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Therefore, since \\(C\\) is an inductive subset, we have \\[\nC \\cap \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M  = \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M \\,.\n\\] By definition of \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) and the above observation we get \\[\nC \\cap {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} = C \\cap \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M  = \\bigcap_{M \\in \\mathcal{M}} M  = {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,.\n\\] Now, by definition of intersection of sets, we have \\[\n({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\cap C) \\subset C \\,.\n\\] Since \\[\n({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\cap C) = {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\,,\n\\] we conclude that \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\subset C\\).\n\n\nThe definition of \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) guarantees that all numbers in \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) are larger than \\(1\\).\n\nTheorem 6Let \\(x \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). Then \\[\nx \\geq 1 \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofDefine the set \\[\nC := \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\, \\colon \\,x \\geq 1 \\} \\,.\n\\] We have that \\(C\\) is an inductive subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nBy definition \\(1 \\in C\\). Suppose now that \\(x \\in C\\), so that \\(x \\geq 1\\). Since \\(1 \\geq 0\\) as a consequence of the field axioms, we deduce that \\[\nx + 1 \\geq x + 0 = x \\geq 1 \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(x + 1 \\geq 1\\). Thus \\((x + 1) \\in C\\).\n\nBy Theorem 5 we conclude that \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\subset C \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(x \\geq 1\\) for all \\(x \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\).\n\n\n\nNotation 7We have just shown that all the numebers \\(x \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) satisfy \\[\nx \\geq 1 \\,.\n\\] Moreover by the fact that \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) is an inductive set, we know that \\[\n1 + 1 \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,,\n\\] since \\(1 \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). We denote \\[\n2 := 1 + 1\\,.\n\\] Similarly, we will have that \\[\n2 + 1 \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\,,\n\\] since \\(2 \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). We denote \\[\n3 := 2 + 1\\,.\n\\] In this way we give a name to all the numbers in \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\).\n\n\nAnother consequence of the definition of \\({\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\) and the field axioms is the Principle of Induction.\n\nTheorem 8: Principle of InductionLet \\(\\alpha(x)\\) be a statement depending on \\(n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\). Assume that\n\n\\(\\alpha(1)\\) is true.\nIf \\(\\alpha(n)\\) is true then also \\(\\alpha(n+1)\\) is true.\n\nThen \\(\\alpha(n)\\) is true for all \\(n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\).\n\n\n\nProofDefine the set \\[\nC:=\\{  x \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\, \\colon \\,\\alpha(n) \\mbox{ is true} \\} \\,.\n\\] We have that \\(C\\) is an inductive subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nIndeed: - \\(1 \\in C\\) since \\(\\alpha(1)\\) is true by assumption. - If \\(n \\in C\\) then \\(\\alpha(n)\\) is true. By assumption \\(\\alpha(n+1)\\) is true. Therefore \\((n+1) \\in C\\).\n\nBy Theorem 5 we conclude that \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\subset C\\,.\n\\] As by definition \\(C \\subset {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\), we have proven that \\[\n{\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} = C \\,,\n\\] showing that \\(\\alpha(n)\\) is true for all \\(n \\in {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}}\\).\n\n\n\nNotation 9From now on we denote \\[\n\\mathbb{N}:= {\\mathbb{N}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,,  \\quad\n\\mathbb{Z}:= {\\mathbb{Z}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,,  \\quad\n\\mathbb{Q}:= {\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\mathbb{R}} \\,.  \\quad\n\\]"

Indeed, we have \\[\n(\\alpha - 1) &lt; \\alpha \\,.\n\\tag{4.2}\\] Therefore \\(\\alpha-1\\) cannot be an upper bound for \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Indeed, if by contradiction \\(\\alpha - 1\\) was an upper bound for \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), then we would have \\[\n\\alpha \\leq (\\alpha - 1)\\,,\n\\] since \\(\\alpha\\) is the smallest upper bound for \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). This contradicts (4.2). Therefore \\(\\alpha - 1\\) is not an upper bound for \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).\nConclusion. Since \\(\\alpha - 1\\) is not an upper bound for \\(\\mathbb{N}\\), there exists \\(n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\n\\alpha - 1 &lt; n_0 \\,.\n\\] The above implies \\[\n\\alpha &lt; n_0 + 1 \\,.\n\\] Since \\[\n(n_0+1) \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,,\n\\] we have obtained a contradiction, given that \\(\\alpha\\) was the supremum of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). Thus (4.1) is false, meaning that there exists \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nn &gt; x \\,.\n\\]\nPart 2. Suppose \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(x&gt;0\\). We can define \\[\ny:=\\frac1x \\,.\n\\] By Part 1 there exists \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nn &gt; y = \\frac{1}{x} \\,.\n\\] Using that \\(x&gt;0\\), we can rearrange the above inequlaity to obtain \\[\n\\frac1n &lt; x \\,,\n\\] which is the desired thesis.\n\n\nThere is another formulation of the Archimedean Property which, depending on the situation, might be more useful. This formulation says the following: If \\(x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) are such that \\[\n0 &lt; x &lt; y \\,,\n\\] then there exists \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nnx &gt; y \\,.\n\\] In other words, if one does \\(n\\) steps of size \\(x\\) in the positive numbers direction, then the resulting number \\(nx\\) will be larger than \\(y\\).

By construction we have \\[\na_i \\leq b_n \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, i \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] Therefore \\(b_n\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\). Since the supremum is the smallest upper bound, we conclude that \\[\nx \\leq b_n \\,.\n\\] The index \\(n\\) was chosen arbitrarily, and therefore \\[\nx \\leq b_n \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] In total we have \\[\na_n \\leq x \\leq b_n \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,,\n\\] showing that \\(x\\) satisfies (4.6). Therefore (4.5) holds and the proof is concluded.\n\n\n\nImportantThe assumption that \\(I_n\\) is closed is crucial in Theorem 14. Without such assumption the thesis of Theorem 14 does not hold in general, as seen in Example 15 below.\n\n\n\nExample 15Consider the open intervals \\[\nI_n := \\left( 0, \\frac1n \\right) \\,.\n\\] These are clearly nested \\[\nI_n \\supset I_{n+1}\\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] For this choice of \\(I_n\\) we have \\[\n\\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty I_n = \\emptyset \\,.\n\\tag{4.7}\\] Indeed, suppose by contradiction that the intersection is non-empty. Then there exists \\(x \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\nx \\in I_n \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] By definition of \\(I_n\\) the above reads \\[\n0 &lt; x &lt; \\frac1n  \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\tag{4.8}\\] Since \\(x&gt;0\\), by the Archimedean Property in Theorem 11 Point 2, there exists \\(n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{1}{n_0} &lt; x \\,.\n\\] The above contradicts (4.8). Therefore (4.7) holds."

    "text": "4.4 Revisiting Sup and inf\nWe now investigate some of the properties of supremum and infimum in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). The first property is an alternative characterization of the supremum, which we will often use. A sketch of such characterization is in Figure 4.4 below.\n\nProposition 16: Characterization of Supremum\nLet \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) be a non-empty set. Suppose that \\(s \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\). They are equivalent:\n\n\\(s = \\sup A\\)\nFor every \\(\\varepsilon&gt; 0\\) there exists \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\[\ns - \\varepsilon&lt; x \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: Let \\(s = \\sup A\\). Then for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) there exist \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(s-\\varepsilon&lt;x\\).\n\n\n\nProof: Proof of Proposition 16Step 1. Assume that \\[\ns = \\sup A \\,.\n\\] Let \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) be arbitrary. We clearly have that \\[\ns - \\varepsilon&lt; s \\,.\n\\tag{4.9}\\] Therefore \\((s-\\varepsilon)\\) cannot be an upper bound of \\(A\\). Indeed, if by contradiction \\((s-\\varepsilon)\\) was an upper bound, then we would have \\[\ns \\leq (s - \\varepsilon)\\,,\n\\] since \\(s\\) is the smallest upper bound. The above contradicts (4.9), and therefore \\((s-\\varepsilon)\\) is not an upper bound for \\(A\\). Hence there exists some \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\[\ns - \\varepsilon&lt; x  \\, ,\n\\] concluding.\nStep 2. Assume that Point 2 in the statement of Proposition 16 holds. By assumption we have that \\(s\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\). Suppose by contradiction that \\[\ns \\neq \\sup A \\,.\n\\] This is equivalent to the statement \\[\ns \\, \\mbox{ is not the smallest upper bound of } \\, A.\n\\tag{4.10}\\] Hence there exists an upper bound \\(b\\) of \\(A\\) such that \\[\nb &lt; s \\,.\n\\] Let \\[\n\\varepsilon:= s - b \\,.\n\\] By assumption there exists \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\[\ns - \\varepsilon&lt; x \\,.\n\\] Substituting the definition of \\(\\varepsilon\\) we get \\[\ns - s + b &lt; x \\quad \\implies \\quad b &lt; x \\,.\n\\] Since \\(b\\) is an upper bound for \\(A\\) and \\(x \\in A\\), the above is a contradiction. Therefore (4.10) is false, and \\(s\\) is the smallest upper bound of \\(A\\). Thus \\(s = \\sup A\\).\n\n\nThe analogue of Proposition 16 is as follows. The proof is left as an exercise.\n\nProposition 17: Characterization of Infimum\nLet \\(A \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\) be a non-empty set. Suppose that \\(i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\). They are equivalent:\n\n\\(i = \\inf A\\)\nFor every \\(\\varepsilon\\in \\mathbb{R}\\), with \\(\\varepsilon&gt; 0\\), there exists \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\[\nx &lt; i + \\varepsilon\\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nA sketch of the characterization in Proposition 17 can be found in Figure 4.5 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: Let \\(i = \\inf A\\). Then for every \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\) there exist \\(x \\in A\\) such that \\(x&lt;i+\\varepsilon\\).\n\n\nWith the above characterizations of supremum and infimum, it is now easier to prove that some candidate number is the supremum or infimum of some set. As an example, let us characterize supremum and infimum of an open interval of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\).\n\nProposition 18Let \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a&lt;b\\). Let \\[\nA:= (a,b) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\, \\colon \\,a &lt; x &lt; b \\}\\,.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\inf A = a \\,, \\quad \\sup A = b \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofWe will only prove that \\[\n\\inf A = a \\,,\n\\] since the proof of \\[\n\\sup A = b\n\\] is similar.\nBy definition of \\(A\\), we have that \\[\na &lt; x \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in A \\,.\n\\] The above says that \\(a\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\).\nClaim. \\(a\\) is the largest lower bound of \\(A\\).\nProof of Claim. Let \\(L\\) be a lower bound for \\(A\\), that is, \\[\nL \\leq x \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, x \\in A \\,.\n\\] We have to prove that \\[\nL \\leq a \\,.\n\\tag{4.11}\\] Indeed suppose by contradiction that (4.11) does not hold, namely that \\[\na &lt; L \\,.\n\\] Since \\(a&lt;b\\) we have \\[\na = \\frac{2a}{2} &lt; \\frac{a+b}{2} &lt; \\frac{2b}{b} = b \\,,\n\\] showing that the midpoint between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) satisfies \\[\n\\frac{a+b}{2} \\in A \\,.\n\\] Since \\(L\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\) we have \\[\nL \\leq \\frac{a+b}{2} &lt; b \\,.\n\\tag{4.12}\\] Consider the midpoint \\[\nM := \\frac{a + L}{2} \\,.\n\\] We have that \\[\nM \\in A \\,.\n\\]\n\nIndeed, recalling that \\(a&lt;L\\), we have \\[\na = \\frac{2a}{2} &lt; \\frac{a+L}{2} = M \\,.\n\\] Moreover by (4.12) we have \\(L&lt;b\\). Thus \\[\nM = \\frac{a+L}{2} \\leq \\frac{a+b}{2} &lt; b \\,.\n\\] This shows \\(M \\in A\\).\n\nMoreover \\[\nM &lt; L \\,.\n\\]\n\nThis is because \\(a&lt;L\\), and therefore \\[\nM = \\frac{a + L}{2} &lt; \\frac{2L}{2} = L \\,.\n\\]\n\nThis is a contradiction, since by assumption \\(L\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\), and thus we should have \\[\nL \\leq M \\,.\n\\] Therefore (4.11) holds, showing that \\(a\\) is the largest lower bound of \\(A\\). Thus \\(a = \\inf A\\).\n\n\nAs a corollary of the above we have that the maximum and minimum of an open interval do not exist.\n\nCorollary 19Let \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a&lt;b\\). Let \\[\nA:= (a,b) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\, \\colon \\,a &lt; x &lt; b \\}\\,.\n\\] Then \\(\\min A\\) and \\(\\max A\\) do not exist.\n\n\n\nProofSuppose by contradiction that \\(\\min A\\) exists. We have shown that if the minimum of a set exists, then it must be \\[\n\\min A = \\inf A \\,.\n\\] Since \\[\n\\inf A = a\\,,\n\\] by Proposition 18, we would obtain that \\[\n\\min A = a \\,.\n\\] By definition \\(\\min A \\in A\\), so that \\(a \\in A\\). This is contradiction. Then \\(\\min A\\) does not exist.\nThe proof that \\(\\max A\\) does not exist is similar, and is left as an exercise.\n\n\nWe can also consider intervals for which one or both of the sides are closed.\n\nCorollary 20Let \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) with \\(a&lt;b\\). Let \\[\nA:= [a,b) = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\, \\colon \\,a \\leq x &lt; b \\}\\,.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\min A = \\inf A = a \\,, \\quad \\sup A = b \\,,\n\\] \\(\\max A\\) does not exist.\n\n\nThe proof is very similar to the ones above, and is left to the reader for exercise. Let us now compute supremum and infimum of a set which is not an interval.\n\nProposition 21Define the set \\[\nA :=  \\left\\{ \\frac1n \\, \\colon \\,n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\} \\,.\n\\] Then \\[\n\\inf A = 0 \\,, \\quad \\sup A = \\max A = 1 \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofPart 1. We have \\[\n\\frac1n \\leq 1 \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,.\n\\] Since \\(1 \\in A\\), we conclude that \\[\n\\max A = \\sup A = 1 \\,.\n\\]\nPart 2. We have \\[\n\\frac1n &gt; 0 \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,,\n\\] showing that \\(0\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\). Suppose by contradiction that \\(0\\) is not the infimum. Therefore \\(0\\) is not the largest lower bound. Then there exists \\(\\varepsilon\\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that:\n\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is a lower bound for \\(A\\), that is, \\[\n\\varepsilon\\leq \\frac1n  \\,, \\quad \\forall \\, n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\,,\n\\tag{4.13}\\]\n\\(\\varepsilon\\) is larger than \\(0\\): \\[\n0 &lt; \\varepsilon\\,.\n\\]\n\nAs \\(\\varepsilon&gt;0\\), by the Archimedean Property there exists \\(n_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) such that \\[\n0 &lt; \\frac{1}{n_0} &lt; \\varepsilon\\,.\n\\] This contradicts (4.13). Thus \\(0\\) is the largest lower bound of \\(A\\), that is, \\(0 = \\inf A\\).\nPart 3. We have that \\(\\min A\\) does not exist. Indeed suppose by contradiction that \\(\\min A\\) exists. Then \\[\n\\min A = \\inf A \\,.\n\\] As \\(\\inf A = 0\\) by Part 2, we conclude \\(\\min A = 0\\). As \\(\\min A \\in A\\), we obtain \\(0 \\in A\\), which is a contradiction."

    "text": "6.1 Example: Heron’s Method\nThe first explicit algorithm for approximating \\[\n\\sqrt{x}\n\\] for \\(x &gt; 0\\) is known as Heron’s method, after the first-century Greek mathematician Heron of Alexandria who described the method in his AD 60 work Metrica, see reference to Wikipedia page.\nLet us see what is the idea of the algorithm:\n\nSuppose that \\(a_1\\) is an approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from above, that is, \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_1 \\,.\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nMultiplying (6.1) by \\(\\sqrt{x}/a_1\\) we obtain \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} \\,,\n\\tag{6.2}\\] obtaining an approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from below.\nTherefore, putting together the above inequalities, \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} &lt; a_1\n\\tag{6.3}\\]\nIf we take the average of the points \\(x/a_1\\) and \\(a_1\\), it is reasonable to think that we find a better approximation of \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). Thus our next approximation is \\[\na_2 := \\frac{1}{2} \\left( a_1 + \\frac{x}{a_1} \\right) \\,,\n\\] see figure below.\n\n\n\n\nHeron’s Algorithm for approximating \\(\\sqrt{x}\\)\n\n\nIterating, we define by recurrence the sequence \\[\na_{n+1} := \\frac12  \\left( a_n + \\frac{x}{a_n} \\right)\n\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\), where the initial guess \\(a_1\\) has to satisfy (6.1). The aim of the section is to show that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\ a_n = \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\tag{6.4}\\] We start by showing that (6.3) holds for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\n\nProposition 1We have \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_n} &lt; \\sqrt{x} &lt; a_n\n\\tag{6.5}\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\).\n\n\n\nProofWe prove it by induction:\n\nBy (6.1) and (6.2) we know that (6.5) holds for \\(n=1\\).\nSuppose now that (6.5) holds for \\(n\\). Then \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} & = \\frac12  \\left( a_n + \\frac{x}{a_n} \\right) - \\sqrt{x} \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n^2 + x - 2 a_n \\sqrt{x} ) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n - \\sqrt{x} )^2 &gt; 0 \\,,\n\\end{align}\\] since we are assuming that \\(a_n &gt; \\sqrt{x}\\). Therefore \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} \\,.\n\\tag{6.6}\\] Multiplying the above by \\(\\sqrt{x}/a_{n+1}\\) we get \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_{n+1}} &lt; \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\tag{6.7}\\] Inequalities (6.6) and (6.7) show that (6.5) holds for \\(n+1\\).\n\nTherefore we conclude (6.5) by the Principle of Induction.\n\n\nWe are now ready to prove error estimates, that is, estimating how far away \\(a_n\\) is from \\(\\sqrt{x}\\).\n\nProposition 2: Error estimateFor all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) we have \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac12 (a_{n} - \\sqrt{x}) \\,.\n\\tag{6.8}\\]\n\n\n\nProofBy Proposition 1 we know that \\[\n\\frac{x}{a_n} &lt; \\sqrt{x}\n\\] for all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+1} & = \\frac12 \\left(  a_n +  \\frac{x}{a_n}   \\right) \\\\\n        & &lt; \\frac12 \\left(  a_n +  \\sqrt{x}   \\right) \\,.\n\\end{align}\\] Subtracting \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) from both members in the above inequality we get the thesis.\n\n\nInequality (6.8) is saying that the error halves at each step. Therefore we can prove that after \\(n\\) steps the error is exponentially lower, as detailed in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 3For all \\(n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) we have \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x})\n\\tag{6.9}\\]\n\n\n\nProofWe prove (6.9) by induction:\n\nFor \\(n=1\\) we have that (6.9) is satisfied, since it coincides with (6.8) for \\(n=1\\).\nSuppose that (6.9) holds for \\(n\\). By (6.8) with \\(n\\) replaced by \\(n+1\\) we have \\[\\begin{align}\na_{n+2} - \\sqrt{x} & &lt; \\frac12 (a_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x}) \\\\\n& &lt; \\frac12 \\,\\cdot \\, \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_{1} - \\sqrt{x}) \\\\\n& = \\frac{1}{2^{n+1}} (a_{1} - \\sqrt{x})\n\\end{align}\\] where in the second inequality we used the induction hypothesis (6.9). Hence (6.9) holds for \\(n+1\\).\n\nBy invoking the Induction Principle we conclude the proof.\n\n\nLet us comment estimate (6.9). Denote the error at step \\(n\\) by \\[\ne_n := a_n - \\sqrt{x}\\,.\n\\] The initial error \\(e_1\\) depends on how far the initial guess is from \\(\\sqrt{x}\\). The estimate in (6.9) is telling us that \\(e_n\\) is a fraction of \\(e_1\\), and actually \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ e_n = 0\n\\] exponentially fast. From this fact we are finally able to prove (6.4).\n\nTheorem 4: Convergence of Heron’s AlgorithmWe have that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ a_n = \\sqrt{x} \\,.\n\\]\n\n\n\nProofBy Proposition 3 we have that \\[\na_{n+1} - \\sqrt{x} &lt; \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x})\n\\] Moreover Proposition 1 tells us that \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} \\,.\n\\] Putting together the two inequalities above we infer \\[\n\\sqrt{x} &lt; a_{n+1} &lt; \\sqrt{x} + \\frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \\sqrt{x}) \\,.\n\\tag{6.10}\\] Now note that \\[\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\frac{1}{2^n} =\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\ \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)^n = 0 \\,.\n\\] Therefore the RHS of (6.10) converges to \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). Applying the Squeeze Theorem to (6.10) we conclude that \\(a_n \\to \\sqrt{x}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\n\n\n6.1.1 Coding the Algorithm\nHeron’s Algorithm can be easily coded in Python. For example, see the function below:\n# x is the number for which to compute sqrt(x)\n# guess is the point a_1\n# a_1 must be strictly larger than sqrt(x)\n# n is the number of iterations\n# the function returns a_{n+1}\n\ndef herons_algorithm(x, guess, n):\n    for i in range(n):\n        guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2.0\n    return guess\nFor example let us use the Algorithm to compute \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) after \\(3\\) iterations. For initial guess we take \\(a_1 = 2\\).\n# Calculate sqrt(2) with 3 iterations and guess 2\nsqrt_2 = herons_algorithm(2, 2, 3)\n\nprint(f\"The sqrt(2) is approximately {sqrt_2}\")\n\n\nThe sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142156862745097\n\n\nThat is a pretty good approximation in just \\(3\\) iterations!"
