## References {.unnumbered}

We will study curves and surfaces in $\R^3$. I will follow mainly the textbook by Pressley [@pressley]. Other references that inspired these notes are the books by do Carmo [@do-carmo], O'Neill [@o-neill] and BÃ¤r [@bar].


I will assume some knowledge from Analysis and Linear Algebra. A good place to revise these topics are the books by Zorich [@zorich-1; @zorich-2]. In addition, it can be helpful to plot curves and surfaces to aid visualization. I will do this with Python 3. I recommend installation through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). The actual coding can then be done through, for example, [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org). Good references for scientific Python programming are [@johansson;@KSB-Python].
