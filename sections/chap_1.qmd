# Numbers

## Introduction

The aim of this section is to rigorously introduce the set of real numbers $\R$. But what do we mean by real number anyways? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers)
$$
\N = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}
$$
On this set we have a notion of **sum** of two numbers, denoted as usual by $$
n+m
$$ 
for $n,m \in \N$. Here the symbol $\in$ denotes that $m$ and $n$ belong to $\N$. For example $3+7$ results in $10$.



::: Question

Can the sum be inverted?sadl
