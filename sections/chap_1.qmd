# Numbers

## Introduction

The aim of this chapter is to rigorously introduce the set of real numbers $\R$. But what do we mean by real numbers? To start our discussion, introduce the set of natural numbers (or non-negative integers)
$$
\N = \{0,1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}
$$
On this set we have a notion of **sum** of two numbers, denoted as usual by $$
n+m
$$ 
for $n,m \in \N$. Here the symbol $\in$ denotes that $m$ and $n$ belong to $\N$. For example $3+7$ results in $10$.



::: Question

Can the sum be inverted? That is, given any $n,m \in \N$, can you always find $x \in \N$ such that
$$
n+x = m \,?
$$

:::

The answer to the above question is clearly **no**. For example, take $n=10$ and $m=1$. Then $x = -9$, which does not belong to $\N$. We therefore need to **extend** the
set $\N$ in order to invert the sum. This is done simply by introducing the set of **integers** 
$$
\Z := \{ -n,n \, \colon \, n \in \N   \} \,,
$$
that is, the set
$$
\Z := \{ \ldots, -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots \} \,.
$$
The sum can be extended to $\Z$, by defining 
$$
(-n) + (-m) := - (m+n)
$$ {#eq-def-sum-negative}
for all $m,n \in \N$. Now every element of $\Z$ possesses an **inverse**, that is, for each $n \in \Z$, there exists $m \in \Z$, such that
$$
n + m = 0 \,.
$$
What is $m$ for a given $n$? Seeing the definition at (@eq-def-sum-negative), we simply have
$$
m = - n \,.
$$
We can also multiply integers, in the usual way we learnt in school. For 
$n,m \in \Z$, we denote the multiplication by $nm$.


::: Question

Can the multiplication in $\Z$ be inverted? That is, given any $n,m \in \Z$, can you always find $x \in \Z$ such that
$$
nx = m \,?
$$

:::

The answer is of course **no**. Just take $n=2$ and $m=1$. The answer should be $1/2$, but $1/2$ does not belong to $\Z$. Thus, in order to invert the multiplication, we need to **extend** the set of integers. This extension is called the set of **rational numbers**, defined by
$$
\Q := \left\{ \frac{m}{n} \, \colon \, m,n \in \Z, \, n \neq 0    \right\} \,.
$$
In $\Q$ the multiplication is invertible, and each non-zero element has an inverse: the inverse of $m/n$ is given by $n/m$. Moreover by construction
$$
\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \,.
$$


::: Question

How can we draw the set $\Q$?

:::


It is clear how to draw $\Z$, as seen below. 

![Representation of integers](/images/integers.png){#fig-integers width=80%}


However $\Q$ is much **denser** than the elements of $\Z$ represented in @fig-integers. For example, consider $0 \in \Q$. 


::: Question
What is the number $x \in \Q$ which is closest to $0$?
:::

There is no right answer to the above question, since whichever rational number $m/n$ you consider, we can always squeeze the rational number $m / (2n)$ in between:
$$
0 < \frac{m}{2n} < \frac{m}{n} \,.
$$
For example think about the case of the numbers $1/n$ for $n \in \N$ and $n \neq 0$. Such numbers get arbitrarily close to $0$, as depicted below.

Maybe if we do the same reasoning with other progressively smaller rational numbers, we manage to fill out the interval $[0,1]$. In other words, we might conjecture the following. 

::: {.Conjecture #conj-line}
Maybe $\Q$ can be represented by a continuous line.
:::

Do you think the above conjecture is true? If it was, mathematics would be quite boring. Indeed Conjecture \ref{conj-line} is **false**, as shown by the Theorem below.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-root-2}
The number $\sqrt{2}$ does not belong to $\Q$.
:::

The above theorem is the reason why $\sqrt{2}$ is called an irrational number. For reference, a few digits of $\sqrt{2}$ are given by
$$
\sqrt{2} = 1.414213562373095048\ldots
$$
and the situation is as in the picture below.

![Representing $\sqrt{2}$](/images/integers_root_2.png){width=70%}

We can therefore see that Conjecture \ref{conj-line} is **false**, and $\Q$ is not a line, given that it has a **gap** at $\sqrt{2}$. Let us see why 
Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2} is true.


::: Proof
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2}

We prove that $\sqrt{2}$ does not belong to $\Q$ by **contradiction**. This means assuming the existence of $q \in \Q$ such that $q = \sqrt{2}$. In other words
$$
q^2 = 2 \,.
$$ {#eq-contradiction-root-2}
We will show that (@eq-contradiction-root-2) leads to a contradiction. Thus (@eq-contradiction-root-2) must be false, and so 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,,
$$ 
concluding the thesis.
:::


Seeing the above, we might be tempted to just fill in the gap by adding $\sqrt{2}$ to $\Q$. However, with analogous proof to Theorem \ref{theorem-root-2}, we can prove that 
$$
\sqrt{p} \notin \Q
$$ 
for each prime number $p$. Thus $\Q$ has infinite gaps (recall that there are infinite prime numbers). Then we might attempt to fill in these gaps via the extension
$$
\tilde{\Q} := \Q \cup \{ \sqrt{p} \, \colon \, p \, \text{ prime} \} \,.
$$
However even this is not enough, as we would still have numbers which are not contained in $\tilde{Q}$, for example
$$
\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} , \, \pi , \, \pi + \sqrt{2} \notin \tilde{\Q} \,.
$$
The reality of things is that to **complete** $\Q$ and make it into a **continuous line** we have to add a lot of points. Indeed, we need to add way more points than the ones already contained in $\Q$. Such extension of $\Q$ will be called $\R$, the set of **real numbers**. The inclusions will be 
$$
\N \subset \Z \subset \Q \subset \R \,.
$$
The set $\R$ is not at all trivial to construct. In fact, at first we will just assume its **existence** and study its **properties**. We will then provide a concrete **model** for the real numbers $\R$, to prove once and for all that such set indeed exists.

::: Theorem
### To keep in mind for the next lessons

There exists a set $\R$, called the set of real numbers, which extends $\Q$ by filling in all the gaps.
