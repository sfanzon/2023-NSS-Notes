# Sequences in $\mathbb{R}$



A sequence is an infinite list of real numbers. For example, the following are sequences:


- $(1,2,3,4, \ldots)$

- $(-1,1,-1,1, \ldots)$

- $\left(1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \ldots\right)$


::: Remark

- The order of elements in a sequence matters. 

> For example
>$$
>(1,2,3,4,5,6, \ldots) \neq(2,1,4,3,6,5, \ldots)
>$$

- A sequence is not a set. 

> For example 
>$$
>\{-1,1,-1,1,-1,1, \ldots\}=\{-1,1\}
>$$
>but we cannot make a similar statement for the sequence 
>$$
>(-1,1,-1,1,-1,1, \ldots) \,.
>$$

- The above notation is ambiguous.

> For example the sequence 
>$$
>(1,2,3,4, \ldots)
>$$
can continue as
>
>$$
>(1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4, \ldots) \,.
>$$

- In the sequence 
$$
\left(1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \ldots\right)
$$
the elements get smaller and smaller, and closer and closer to $0$. We say that this sequence converges to $0$, or has $0$ as a limit. 


:::


We would like to make the notions of sequence and convergence more precise.


## Definition of sequence


We start with the definition of sequence of Real numbers.


::: Definition 
### Sequence of Real numbers

A sequence $a$ in $\R$ is a map
$$
a \colon \N \to \R \,.
$$
For $n \in \N$, we denote the $n$-th element of the sequence $a$ by 
$$
a_{n}=a(n)
$$ 
and write the sequence as 
$$
\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N} \,.
$$
:::


::: Notation

We will sometimes omit the subscript $n \in \N$ and simply write 
$$
\left(a_{n}\right) \,.
$$ 
In certain situations, we will also write
$$
\left(a_{n}\right)_{n=1}^{\infty} \,.
$$


:::




::: Example 

- In general $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is the sequence 
$$
\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots\right)\,.
$$

- Consider the sequence 
$$
a \colon \N \to \N \, , \quad  n \mapsto 2 n \,.
$$
This is also a sequence of real numbers. It can be written as 
$$
(2 n)_{n \in \N}
$$
and it represents the sequence of even numbers 
$$
(2,4,6,8,10, \ldots) \,.
$$

- Let 
$$
a_{n}=(-1)^{n}
$$
Then $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is the sequence 
$$
(-1,1,-1,1,-1,1, \ldots) \,.
$$

- $\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is the sequence 
$$
\left(1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \ldots\right) \,.
$$


:::



## Convergent sequences


We have notice that the sequence $\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ gets close to $0$ as $n$ gets large. We would like to say that $a_{n}$ converges to $0$ as $n$ tends to infinity.

To make this precise, we first have to say what it means for two numbers to be *close*. For this we use the notion of absolute value, and say that:

- $x$ and $y$ are close if $|x-y|$ is small. 
- $|x-y|$ is called the distance between $x$ and $y$
- For $x$ to be close to $0$, we need that $|x-0|=|x|$ is small.

Saying that $|x|$ is *small* is not very precise. Let us now give the formal definition of convergent sequence.

::: Definition 
### Convergent sequence  {#definition-convergent-sequence}

We say that a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ in $\mathbb{R}$ **converges** to $a \in \mathbb{R}$ or equivalently has limit $a$, denoted by

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \text {, }
$$

if for all $\e \in \mathbb{R}, \e>0$, there exists an $N \in \N$ such that for all $n \in \N, n \geq N$ it holds that 
$$
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$
Using quantifiers, we can write this as
$$
\forall \, \e>0 , \, \exists \, N \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N \,, \,\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$

If there exists $a \in \R$ such that $\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a$, then we say that the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is **convergent**.

:::


::: Remark

- Informally, Definition \ref{definition-convergent-sequence} says that, no matter how small we choose $\e$ (as long as it is strictly positive), we always have that $a_{n}$ has a distance to $a$ of less than or equal to $\e$ from a certain point onwards (i.e., from $N$ onward). The sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ may fluctuate wildly in the beginning, but from $N$ onward it should stay within a distance of $\e$ of $a$.

- In general $N$ depends on $\e$. If $\e$ is chosen smaller, we might have to take $N$ larger: this means we need to wait longer before the sequence stays within a distance $\e$ from $a$.

:::


We now prove that the sequence
$$
a_n = \frac1n
$$
converges to $0$, according to Definition \ref{definition-convergent-sequence}.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-one-over-n}

The sequence $\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ converges to $0$ , i.e.,

$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0 \,.
$$

:::

We give two proofs of the above theorem:

- Long proof, with all the details.
- Short proof, with less details, but still acceptable. 

::: Proof 
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-n} (Long version)

We have to show that

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n}=0,
$$

which by definition is equivalent to showing that

$$
\forall \, \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall  \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{1}{n}-0\right| < \e \,.
$${#eq-one-over-n}

Let $\e \in \mathbb{R}$ with $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e}\,.
$$
Such natural number $N$ exists thanks to the Archimedean property. The above implies
$$
\frac{1}{N} < \e \,,
$${#eq-one-over-n-1}
Let $n \in \N$ with $n \geq N$. By (@eq-one-over-n-1) we have
$$
\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} < \e \,.
$$
From this we deduce
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n}-0\right|=\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} < \e
$$

Since $n \in \N, n \geq N$ was arbitrary, we have proven that 
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n}-0\right| < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$${#eq-one-over-n-2}
Condition (@eq-one-over-n-2) holds for all $\e>0$, for the choice of $N \in \N$ such that
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e} \,.
$$
We have hence shown (@eq-one-over-n), and the proof is concluded.

:::

As the above proof is quite long and includes lots of details, it is acceptable to shorten it. For example:

- We skip some intermediate steps.
- We do not mention the Archimedean property.
- We leave out the conclusion when it is obvious that the statement has been proven. 




::: Proof 
### Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-n} (Short version)

We have to show that

$$
\forall \, \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall  \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{1}{n}-0\right| < \e \,.
$$

Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e}\,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Then
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n}-0\right|=\frac{1}{n} \leq \frac{1}{N} < \e \,.
$$

:::


In Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-n} we showed that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{1}{n} = 0 \,.
$$
We can generalise this statement to prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{1}{n^{p}} = 0
$$
for any $p>0$ fixed.


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-one-over-np}
For all $p>0$, the sequence $\left(\frac{1}{n^{p}}\right)_{n \in \N}$ converges to $0$ , i.e.,

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{n^{p}}=0
$$
:::

::: Proof

Let $p>0$. We have to show that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{1}{n^{p}}-0\right| < \e \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e^{1 / p}} \,.
$${#eq-theorem-one-over-np-1}
Let $n \geq N$. Since $p>0$, we have $n^{p} \geq N^{p}$, which implies 
$$
\frac{1}{n^p} \leq \frac{1}{N^p} \,.
$$
By (@eq-theorem-one-over-np-1) we deduce
$$
\frac{1}{N^p} < \e \,.
$$
Then
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n^{p}}-0\right|=\frac{1}{n^{p}} \leq \frac{1}{N^{p}} < \e \,.
$$

:::

::: Question
Why did we choose $N \in \N$ such that
$$
N > \frac{1}{\e^p}
$$
in the above proof?
:::

The answer is: because it works. Finding a number $N$ that makes the proof work requires some *rough work*: Specifically, such rough work consists in finding $N \in \N$ such that the inequality
$$
|a_N - a | < \e 
$$
is satisfied. 


::: Important 

Any *rough work* required to prove convergence must be shown before the formal proof (in assignments). 

:::




::: Example 

Prove that, as $n \rightarrow \infty$,

$$
\frac{n}{2n+3} \to \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$

*Part 1. Rough Work.*

Let $\e>0$. We want to find $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
To this end, we compute:
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2 n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| & 
=\left|\frac{2n -(2n + 3)}{2(2n +3)}\right| \\
& =\left|\frac{- 3}{4n + 6}\right| \\
& = \frac{3}{4n + 6} \,.
\end{align*}
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e
\quad \iff &  \quad
\frac{3}{4n + 6} < \e \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
\frac{4n + 6}{3} > \frac{1}{\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
4n + 6 > \frac{3}{\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
4n  > \frac{3}{\e} - 6 \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
n  > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4} \,.
\end{align*}
Looking at the above equivalences, it is clear that $N \in \N$ has to be chosen so that
$$
N  > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4} \,.
$$


*Part 2. Formal Proof.* We have to show that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e  \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that
$$
N > \frac{3}{4\e} - \frac{6}{4}   \,.
$${#eq-example-limit-1}
By the rough work shown above, inequality (@eq-example-limit-1) is equivalent to 
$$
 \frac{3}{4N + 6} < \e \,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n}{2n+3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| 
& = \left|\frac{- 3 }{2(2 n+3)}\right| \\
& = \frac{3}{4 n+ 6 } \\
& \leq \frac{3}{4 N+ 6 } \\
& < \e \,,
\end{align*}
where in the third line we used that $n \geq N$.

:::


We conclude by showing that constant sequences always converge.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-constant-sequence}

Let $c \in \R$ and define the constant sequence
$$
a_n := c \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
We have that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, a_n = c \,.
$$

:::

::: Proof

We have to prove that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|a_n - c \right| < \e  \,.
$${#eq-constant-sequence}
Let $\e>0$. We have
$$
\left|a_n - c \right| = \left|c - c \right| = 0 < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore we can choose $N=1$ and (@eq-constant-sequence) is satisfied. 
:::




## Divergent sequences


The opposite of convergent sequences are divergent sequences.

::: Definition
### Divergent sequence

We say that a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ in $\R$ is **divergent** if it is not convergent.

:::



::: Remark

Proving that a sequence $(a_n)$ is divergent is more complicated than showing it is convergent: To show that $(a_n)$ is divergent, we need to show that 
$(a_n)$ cannot converge to $a$ for any $a \in \R$.

In other words, we have to show that there does not exist an $a \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \, a_n = a  \,.
$$
Using quantifiers, this means
$$
\nexists \, a \in \R \st \forall \, \e>0 \,, \, 
\exists \, N \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N \,, \,
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to showing that
$$
\forall \, a \in \R \,, \, \exists \, \e > 0 \st  \forall \, N \in \N \,, \, \exists \, n \geq N \st \left|a_{n}-a\right| \geq \e \,.
$$

:::



::: {.Theorem #theorem-1-minus-n}
Let $\left(a_{n}\right)$ be the sequence defined by
$$
a_{n}=(-1)^{n} \,.
$$
Then $\left(a_{n}\right)$ does not converge. 

:::

::: Proof

To prove that $\left(a_{n}\right)$ does not converge, we have to show that 
$$
\forall \, a \in \R \,, \, \exists \, \e > 0 \st  \forall \, N \in \N \,, \, \exists \, n \geq N \st \left|a_{n}-a\right| \geq \e \,.
$$
Let $a \in \R$. Choose 
$$
\e=\frac{1}{2} \,.
$$ 
Let $N \in \N$. We distinguish two cases:

- $a \geq 0$: Choose $n=2 N+1$. Note that $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|a_{n}-a\right| & = \left|a_{2 N+1}-a\right| \\
& = \left|(-1)^{2 N+1}-a\right| \\
& =|-1-a| \\
& =1+a \\
& \geq 1 \\
& > \frac{1}{2} = \e \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $a \geq 0$, and therefore 
$$
|-1-a|=1+a \geq 1 \,.
$$

- $a<0$: Choose $n=2 N$. Note that $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|a_{n}-a\right| & = \left|a_{2 N}-a\right| \\
& =\left|(-1)^{2 N}-a\right| \\ 
& = |1-a| \\
& = 1-a \\
& > 1 \\
& > \frac{1}{2} = \e \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that $a < 0$, and therefore 
$$
|1-a|=1-a > 1 \,.
$$


:::



## Uniqueness of limit


In Definition \ref{definition-convergent-sequence} of convergence, we used the notation 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \,.
$$ 
The above notation makes sense only if the limit is unique, that is, if we do not have that  
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = b \,,
$$ 
for some 
$$
a \neq b \,.
$$
In the next theorem we will show that the limit is unique, if it exists.

::: Theorem 
### Uniqueness of limit  {#theorem-uniqueness-limit}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ be a sequence. Suppose that 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = a \,, \quad 
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = b \,.
$$
Then $a=b$.
:::


::: Proof

Assume that, 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = a \,, \quad 
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n} = b \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that
$$
a \neq b \,.
$$
Choose 
$$
\e := \frac{1}{2} \, |a-b| \,.
$$
Therefore $\e>0$, since $|a-b|>0$. By the convergence $a_{n} \rightarrow a$,
$$
\exists \, N_1 \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,, \, 
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \e \,.
$$
By the convergence $a_{n} \rightarrow b$,
$$
\exists \, N_2 \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,, \, 
\left|a_{n} - b \right| < \e \,.
$$
Define
$$
N := \max \{ N_1, N_2 \} \,.
$$
Choose an $n \in \N$ such that $n \geq N$. In particular
$$
n \geq N_1 \,, \quad n \geq N_2 \,.
$$
Then
\begin{align*}
2 \e & = |a-b| \\
& = \left|a-a_{n}+a_{n}-b\right| \\
& \leq\left|a-a_{n}\right|+\left|a_{n}-b\right| \\
& < \e + \e \\
& = 2 \e \,,
\end{align*}
where we used the triangle inequality in the first inequality.
Hence $2 \e < 2 \e$, which gives a contradiction.

:::


::: Example 

Prove that

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

According to Theorem \ref{theorem-uniqueness-limit}, it suffices to show that the sequence 
$$
\left(\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}\right)_{n \in \N}
$$ 
converges to $\frac{1}{2}$, since then $\frac{1}{2}$ can be the only limit.


*Part 1. Rough Work.*

Let $\e>0$. We want to find $N \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} - \frac{1}{2}\right| < \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
To this end, we compute:
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| 
& =\left|\frac{2\left(n^{2}-1\right)-\left(2 n^{2}-3\right)}{2\left(2 n^{2}-3\right)}\right| \\
& =\left|\frac{1}{4 n^{2}-6}\right| \\
& =\frac{1}{4 n^{2}-6} \\
& =\frac{1}{3 n^{2}+n^{2}-6} \\
& \leq \frac{1}{3 n^{2}} 
\end{align*}
which holds if $n \geq 3$, since in this case $n^2 - 6 \geq 0$.
Therefore 
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}-\frac{1}{2}\right|  < \e
\quad \impliedby &  \quad
\frac{1}{3n^2} < \e \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
3n^2  > \frac{1}{\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
n^2  > \frac{1}{3\e} \\
\quad \iff &  \quad
n  > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\e}} \,.
\end{align*}
Looking at the above implications, it is clear that $N \in \N$ has to be chosen so that
$$
N  > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\e}} \,.
$$
Moreover we need to recall that $N$ has to satisfy 
$$
N \geq 3
$$ 
for the estimates to hold.


*Part 2. Formal Proof.* We have to show that
$$
\forall \e>0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| < \e  \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. Choose $N \in \N$ such that
$$
N > \max \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\e}}, 3 \right\}   \,.
$$
Let $n \geq N$. Then
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3}-\frac{1}{2}\right| 
& =\frac{1}{4 n^{2}-6} \\
& =\frac{1}{3 n^{2}+n^{2}-6} \\
& \leq \frac{1}{3 n^{2}} \\
& \leq \frac{1}{3 N^{2}} \\
& < \e \,,
\end{align*}
where we used that 
$$
n \geq N \geq 3 
$$ 
which implies 
$$
n^2 - 6 \geq 0\,,
$$
in the third line. The last inequality holds, since it is equivalent 
to 
$$
N > \frac{1}{\sqrt{3 \e}} \,.
$$

## Bounded sequences


An important property of sequences is boundedness. 


::: Definition 
### Bounded sequence  {#definition-bounded-sequence}

A sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \N}$ is called **bounded** if there exists a constant $M \in \R$, with $M>0$, such that
$$
\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$

:::

Definition \ref{definition-bounded-sequence} says that a sequence is bounded, if we can find some constant $M>0$ (possibly very large), such that for all elements of the sequence it holds that 
$$
\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M \,,
$$
or equivalently, that 
$$
-M \leq a_{n} \leq M \,.
$$


We now show that any sequence that converges is also bounded

::: {.Theorem  #theorem-convergent-bounded}

If a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges, then the sequence is bounded.

:::


::: Proof 

Suppose the sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ converges and let
$$
a: = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}
$$
By definition of convergence we have that
$$
\forall \, \e >0 \,, \, \exists N \in \N  \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|a_{n}-a \right| < \e \,.
$$
In particular, we can choose
$$
\e = 1
$$ 
and let $N \in \N$ be that value such that
$$
\left|a_{n}-a \right| < 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
If $n \geq N$ we have, by the triangle inequality,
\begin{align*}
\left|a_{n}\right| & = \left|a_{n}-a+a\right| \\
                   & \leq \left|a_{n}-a\right|+|a| \\
                   & < 1+|a| \,.
\end{align*}
Set
$$
M:=\max \left\{\left|a_{1}\right|,\left|a_{2}\right|, \ldots,\left|a_{N-1}\right|, 1+|a|\right\} \,.
$$
Note that such maximum exists, being the set finite. Then 
$$
\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $(a_n)$ is bounded.

:::


The choice of $M$ in the above proof says that the sequence can behave wildly for a finite number of terms. After that, it will stay close to the value of the limit, if the latter exists.

::: Example

In Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-n} we have shown that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \,  \frac{1}{n} = 0 
$$
Hence, it follows from Theorem \ref{theorem-convergent-bounded} that the sequence $(1/n)$ is bounded.

Indeed, we have that
$$
\left|\frac{1}{n}\right|=\frac{1}{n} \leq 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
since $n \geq 1$ for all $n \in \N$.

:::


::: Warning

The converse of Theorem \ref{theorem-convergent-bounded} does not hold: There exist sequences $(a_n)$ which are bounded, but not convergent.

:::


::: Example

Define the sequence
$$
a_n = (-1)^n \,.
$$
We have proven in Theorem \ref{theorem-1-minus-n} that $(a_n)$ is not convergent. However
$(a_n)$ is bounded, with $M=1$, since
$$
|a_n| = |(-1)^n| = 1 = M  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$

:::



Taking the contrapositive of the statement in Theorem \ref{theorem-convergent-bounded} we get the following corollary:


::: {.Corollary   #corollary-convergent-bounded}

If a sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is not bounded, then the sequence does not converge.

:::


::: Remark

For a sequence $(a_n)$ to be unbounded, it means that
$$
\forall \, M > 0 \,, \,\,  \exists \, n \in \N \st \left|a_{n}\right| > M \,.
$$
The above is saying that no real number $M>0$ can be a bound for $|a_n|$, since there is always an index $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
|a_n| > M \,.
$$

:::


We can use Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded} to show that certain sequences do not converge.


::: Theorem 

For all $p>0$, the sequence $\left(n^{p}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ does not converge.

:::


::: Proof
Let $p>0$. We prove that the sequence $\left(n^{p}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded, that is, 
$$
\forall \, M > 0 \,, \,\,  \exists \, n \in \N \st \left|a_{n}\right| > M \,.
$$
To this end, let $M > 0$. Choose $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n > M^{1/p} \,.
$$
Then
$$
a_n = n^{p}>\left(M^{1/p}\right)^{p}=M \,.
$$
This proves that the sequence $(n^p)$ is unbounded. Hence $(n^p)$ cannot converge, by Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded}.

::: Theorem

The sequence $(\log n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ does not converge.

:::


::: Proof 

Let us show that $(\log n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is unbounded, that is, 
$$
\forall \, M > 0  \,, \,\,  \exists \, n \in \N \st \left|a_{n}\right| > M \,.
$$
To this end let $M > 0$. Choose $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n \geq e^{M+1} \,.
$$
Then
$$
|a_n| = |\log n| \geq \left|   \log e^{M+1}   \right| = M + 1 > M \,.
$$
This proves that the sequence $(\log n)$ is unbounded. Hence $(\log n)$ cannot converge, by Corollary \ref{corollary-convergent-bounded}.

## Algebra of limits

Proving convergence using Definition \ref{definition-convergent-sequence} can be a tedious task. In this section we discuss how to prove convergence, starting from known convergence results.


::: Theorem 
### Algebra of limits {#theorem-algebra-limits} 

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(b_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Suppose that, for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$

$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \quad \text { and } \quad \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}=b \text {. }
$$

Then,

1. Limit of sum is the sum of limits:
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_{n} \pm b_{n}\right)=a \pm b
$$

2. Limit of product is the product of limits: 
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left(a_{n}  b_{n}\right) = a  b 
$$

3. If $b_{n} \neq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $b \neq 0$, then 
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left(\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}\right)=\frac{a}{b} 
$$

:::




::: Proof 


 Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $\left(b_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be sequences in $\mathbb{R}$ and let $c \in \mathbb{R}$. Suppose that, for some $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n}=a \,, \quad  \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} b_{n}=b \,.
$$


*Proof of Point 1.* 

We need to show that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n \pm  b_n) = a \pm b \,.
$$
We only give a proof of the formula with $+$, since the case with $-$ follows with a very similar proof. Hence, we need to show that
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists  \, N \in \N \st \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|(a_{n} + b_n) - (a+b)  \right| < \e \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$ and set
$$
\widetilde{\e} := \frac{\e}{2} \,.
$$
Since $a_{n} \rightarrow a$ and $\widetilde{\e}>0$, there exists $N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
|a_n - a|< \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,.
$$
Since $b_{n} \rightarrow b$ and $\widetilde{\e}>0$, there exists $N_2 \in \N$ such that
$$
|b_n - b|< \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,.
$$
Define
$$
N : = \max  \{ N_1, N_2 \} \,.
$$
For all $n \geq N$ we have, by the triangle inequality,
\begin{align*}
\left|\left(a_{n}+b_{n}\right)-(a+b)\right| 
& = \left|\left(a_{n}-a\right) + \left(b_{n}-b\right)\right| \\
& \leq \left|a_{n}-a\right|+\left|b_{n}-b\right| \\
& < \widetilde{\e}+\widetilde{\e} \\
& =\e \,.
\end{align*}



*Proof of Point 2.*


We need to show that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} (a_n  b_n) = a b  \,,
$$
which is equivalent to 
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|a_{n} b_{n} - a b \right| < \e \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$. The sequence $\left(a_{n}\right)$ converges, and hence is bounded, by Theorem \ref{theorem-convergent-bounded}. This means there exists some $M>0$ such that 
$$
\left|a_{n}\right| \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Define 
$$
\widetilde{\e} = \frac{\e}{ M + |b| } \,. 
$$
Since $a_{n} \rightarrow a$ and $\widetilde{\e} > 0$, there exists 
$N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
| a_n  - a | < \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,.
$$
Since $b_{n} \rightarrow b$ and $\widetilde{\e} > 0$, there exists 
$N_2 \in \N$ such that
$$
| b_n  - b | < \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,.
$$
Let 
$$
N:= \max\{ N_1, N_2 \} \,.
$$
For all $n \geq N$ we have
\begin{align*}
\left|a_{n}b_{n}-a b\right| 
& = \left|a_{n} b_{n} - a_n  b + a_n  b - a  b \right| \\
& \leq \left|a_{n}  b_{n} - a_n  b \right| + \left|a_n  b - a b \right| \\
& =\left|a_{n}\right| \left|b_{n}-b\right|+ |b|  \left|a_{n}-a\right| \\
& < M \, \widetilde{\e} +|b| \, \widetilde{\e} \\
& = (M + |b|) \, \widetilde{\e} \\
& = \e  \,.
\end{align*}


*Proof of Point 3.* 

Suppose in addition that $b_n \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$. We need to show that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{a_n}{b_n} = \frac{a}{b} \,,
$$
which is equivalent to
$$
\forall \, \e > 0 \,, \, \exists \, N \in \N \st  \forall \, n \geq N \,, \, \left|\frac{a_{n}}{ b_{n}} - \frac{a}{b} \right| < \e \,.
$$
We suppose in addition that $b>0$. The proof is very similar for the case $b <0$. Let $\e > 0$. Set
$$
\delta := \frac{b}{2} \,.
$$
Since $b_n \to b$ and $\delta>0$, there exists $N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
|b_n - b| < \delta \, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,.
$$
In particular we have
$$
b_n > b - \delta = b - \frac{b}{2} = \frac{b}{2}   \, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,.
$$
Define
$$
\widetilde{\e} := \frac{ b^2 }{ 2 (b + |a|)} \, \e \,.
$$
Since $\widetilde{\e}>0$ and $a_n \to a$, there exists $N_2 \in \N$ such that
$$
|a_n - a |< \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,.
$$
Since $\widetilde{\e}>0$ and $b_n \to b$, there exists $N_3 \in \N$ such that
$$
|b_n - b |< \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_3 \,.
$$
Define
$$
N:= \max\{ N_1, N_2, N_3 \} \,.
$$
For all $n \geq N$ we have
\begin{align*}
\left|\frac{a_{n}}{ b_{n}} - \frac{a}{b} \right| & = 
\left|\frac{a_{n} b - a b_n}{ b_{n} b }  \right| \\
& = \frac{1}{ \left|b_{n} b \right|} \,  
\left| a_{n}b - a b + a b - a b_n    \right| \\
& = \frac{1}{ \left|b_{n} b \right|} \,  
\left| (a_{n} - a) b + a(b-b_n)   \right| \\
& \leq \frac{1}{ \left|b_{n} b \right|} \,  
\left( |a_{n} - a| |b| + |a| |b-b_n| \right) \\
& < \frac{1}{ \dfrac{b}{2} \, b } \, \left(  \widetilde{\e} \, b + \widetilde{\e} |a|   \right) \\
& = \frac{2 (b + |a|) }{b^2} \, \widetilde{\e} \\
& = \e \,.
\end{align*}

:::



In the future we will refer to Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} as the *Algebra of Limits*. We now show how to use Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} for computing certain limits. 


::: {.Example  #example-limit-ploynomial}
Prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{3 n}{7 n+4} = \frac{3}{7} \,.
$$


> *Proof*. We can rewrite
$$
\frac{3 n}{7 n+4}=\frac{3}{7+\dfrac{4}{n}}
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-constant-sequence} we know that
$$
3 \rightarrow 3\,,  \quad 4 \to 4 \,, \quad 7 \to 7 \,.
$$
From Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-n}  we know that 
$$
\frac{1}{n} \rightarrow 0 \,.
$$
Hence, it follows from Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 that 
$$
\frac{4}{n} = 4 \cdot \frac1n \rightarrow 4 \cdot 0 = 0 \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 1 we have
$$
7 + \frac{4}{n} \rightarrow  7 + 0 = 7 \,.
$$
Finally we can use Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 3 to infer
$$
\frac{3 n}{7 n+4}=\frac{3}{7+\dfrac{4}{n}} \rightarrow \frac{3}{7} \,.
$$

:::


::: Important 

The technique shown in Example \ref{example-limit-ploynomial} is useful to compute limits of fractions of polynomials. To identify the possible limit, if it exists, it is often best to divide by the largest power of $n$ in the denominator.

:::



::: {.Example #example-algebra-of-limits-2}
Prove that
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$

> *Proof*. Factor $n^2$ to obtain
$$
\frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} \,.
$$
By Theorem \ref{theorem-one-over-np} we have
$$
\frac{1}{n^2} \to 0 \,.
$$
We can then use the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 to infer
$$
\frac{3}{n^2} \to 3 \cdot 0 = 0
$$
and Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 1 to get
$$
1 - \frac{1}{n^2} \to 1 - 0 = 1 \,, \quad 
2 - \frac{3}{n^2} \to 2 - 0 = 2 \,.
$$
Finally we use Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 3 and conclude
$$
 \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} \to \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \, \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \, \frac{1-\dfrac{1}{n^{2}}}{2-\dfrac{3}{n^{2}}} = \frac{1}{2} \,.
$$

:::



We can also use the Algebra of Limits to prove that certain limits do not exist.



::: Example 

Prove that the sequence
$$
a_n = \frac{4 n^{3}+8 n+1}{7 n^{2}+2 n+1}
$$
does not converge.

> *Proof*. To show that the sequence $\left(a_n\right)$ does not converge, we divide by the largest power in the denominator, which in this case is $n^2$
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \frac{4 n^{3}+8 n+1}{7 n^{2}+2 n+1} \\
    & =\frac{4 n+ \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} }{7+  \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} } \\
    & = \frac{b_n}{c_n}
\end{align*}
where we set 
$$
b_n := 4 n+ \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}\,, \quad
c_n := 7 + \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \,.
$$
Using the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} we see that
$$
c_n = 7+  \dfrac{2}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}  \to 7 \,.
$$
Suppose by contradiction that
$$
a_n \to a
$$
for some $a \in \R$. Then, by the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} we would infer
$$
b_n = c_n \cdot a_n \to 7 a \,,
$$
concluding that $b_n$ is convergent to $7a$. We have that
$$
b_n = 4n + d_n \,, \quad d_n := \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \,.
$$
Again by the Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} we get that 
$$
d_n =  \dfrac{8}{n}  +  \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} \to 0 \,,
$$
and hence
$$
4n = b_n - d_n \to 7a - 0 = 7a \,.
$$
This is a contradiction, since the sequence $(4n)$ is unbounded, and hence cannot be convergent. Hence $(a_n)$ is not convergent.
:::



::: Warning

Consider the sequence 
$$
a_n = \frac{4 n^{3}+8 n+1}{7 n^{2}+2 n+1}
$$
from the previous example. We have proven that $(a_n)$ is not convergent, by making use of the Algebra of Limits. 

Let us review a **faulty** argument to conclude that $(a_n)$ is not convergent. Write
$$
a_n = \frac{b_n}{c_n} \,, \quad b_n:= 4 n^{3}+8 n+1\,, 
\quad c_n : =7 n^{2}+2 n+1 \,.
$$
The numerator 
$$
b_n = 4 n^{3}+8 n+1
$$
and denominator 
$$
c_n  =7 n^{2}+2 n+1 
$$
are both unbounded, and hence $(b_n)$ and $(c_n)$ do not converge. One might be tempted to conclude that $(a_n)$ does not converge. However this is **false** in general: as seen in 
Example \ref{example-algebra-of-limits-2}, we have
$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{n^{2}-1}{2 n^{2}-3} = \frac{1}{2} \,,
$$
while numerator and denominator are unbounded.

:::





Sometimes it is useful to rearrange the terms a bit before using the Algebra of Limits.


::: Example 

Define 
$$
 a_n := \frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{8 n+9}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \,.
$$
Prove that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty}  a_n = \frac{8}{15} \,.
$$


> *Proof.* 
The first fraction in $(a_n)$ does not converge, as it is unbounded. Therefore we cannot use Point 2 in Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} directly. However, we note that
\begin{align*}
a_{n} & =\frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{8 n+9}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \\
& = \frac{8 n+9}{5 n+9} \cdot \frac{2 n^{3}+7 n+1}{6 n^{3}+8 n^{2}+3} \,.
\end{align*}
Factoring out $n$ and $n^3$, respectively, and using the Algebra of Limits, we see that
$$
\frac{8 n+9}{5 n+9}=\frac{8+9 / n}{5+9 / n} \to \frac{8+0}{5+0}=\frac{8}{5}
$$
and
$$
\frac{2+7 / n^{2}+1 / n^{3}}{6+8 / n+3 / n^{3}} \to \frac{2+0+0}{6+0+0}=\frac{1}{3}
$$
Therefore Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} Point 2 ensures that
$$
a_{n} \to \frac{8}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{3}=\frac{8}{15} \,.
$$

:::





## Fractional powers


The Algebra of Limits Theorem \ref{theorem-algebra-limits} can also be used when fractional powers of $n$ are involved.

::: Example

Prove that 
$$
a_n = \frac{n^{7 / 3}+2 \sqrt{n}+7}{4 n^{3 / 2}+5 n}
$$
does not converge.

> *Proof*. The largest power of $n$ in the denominator is $n^{3/2}$. Hence we factor out $n^{3/2}$
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \frac{n^{7 / 3}+2 \sqrt{n}+7}{4 n^{3 / 2}+5 n} \\
    & = \frac{n^{7 / 3-3 / 2}+2 n^{1/2 - 3/2} + 7  n^{-3 / 2}}{4 + 5 n^{-3/2} } \\
    & = \frac{n^{5/6}+2 n^{- 1} + 7  n^{-3 / 2}}{4 + 5 n^{-3/2} } \\
    & = \frac{b_n}{c_n}
\end{align*}
where we set
$$
b_n := n^{5/6}+2 n^{- 1} + 7  n^{-3 / 2} \,, \quad 
c_n := 4 + 5 n^{-3/2} \,.
$$
We see that $b_n$ is unbounded while $c_n \to 4$. By the Algebra of Limits (and usual contradiction argument) we conclude that $(a_n)$ is divergent.

:::



We now present a general result about the square root of a sequence.

::: {.Theorem #theorem-square-root-limit}

Let $\left(a_{n}\right)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence in $\mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, a_n = a \,,
$$
for some $a \in \R$. If $a_{n} \geq 0$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $a \geq 0$, then
$$
\lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt{a_{n}}=\sqrt{a} \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof 

Let $\e>0$. We the two cases $a>0$ and $a=0$:

- $a>0$: Define
$$
\delta := \frac{a}{2} \,.
$$
Since $\delta > 0$ and $a_n \to a$, there exists $N_1 \in \N$ such that
$$
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \delta \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,. 
$$
In particular
$$
a_n > a - \delta = a - \frac{a}{2} = \frac{a}{2} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,,
$$
from which we infer
$$
\sqrt{a_n} > \sqrt{a/2} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_1 \,,
$$
Now set
$$
\widetilde{\e} := \left(\sqrt{a/2} + \sqrt{a} \right) \, \e \,.
$$
Since $\widetilde{\e}>0$ and $a_n \to a$, there exists $N_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that 
$$
\left|a_{n}-a\right| < \widetilde{\e} \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N_2 \,. 
$$
Let 
$$
N:= \max\{  N_1, N_2 \} \,.
$$
For $n \geq N$ we have
\begin{align*}
\left|\sqrt{a_{n}}-\sqrt{a}\right| 
& = \left|\frac{\left(\sqrt{a_{n}}-\sqrt{a}\right)\left(\sqrt{a_{n}}+\sqrt{a}\right)}{\sqrt{a_{n}}+\sqrt{a}}\right| \\
& = \frac{\left|a_{n}-a\right|}{\sqrt{a_{n}}+\sqrt{a}} \\
& < \frac{ \widetilde{\e} }{\sqrt{a/2} + \sqrt{a}}  \\
& = \e \,.
\end{align*}


- $a=0$: In this case
$$
a_n \to a = 0 \,.
$$
Since $\e^2>0$, there exists $N \in \N$ such that
$$
|a_n - 0 | = |a_n| < \e^2 \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$
Therefore
$$
|\sqrt{a_n} - \sqrt{0} | = | \sqrt{a_n}| < \sqrt{\e^2} = \e \,, \quad \forall \, n \geq N \,.
$$

Let us show an application of Theorem \ref{theorem-square-root-limit}.


::: Example 

Define the sequence
$$
a_n  = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n \,.
$$
Prove that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \, a_n = \frac12 \,.
$$


> *Proof*. We first rewrite
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n \\
& = \frac{\left(\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n\right)\left(\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n\right)}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \\
& =\frac{9 n^{2}+3 n+1-(3 n)^{2}}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \\
& =\frac{3 n+1}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \, .
\end{align*}
The biggest power of $n$ in the denominator is $n$. Therefore we factor out $n$:
\begin{align*}
a_n & = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-3 n \\
& =\frac{3 n+1}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+3 n} \\
& =\frac{3+ \dfrac{1}{n} }{\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n} + \dfrac{1}{n^{2}}} + 3 } \,.
\end{align*}
By the Algebra of Limits we have
$$
9+ \frac{3}{n} + \frac{1}{n^{2}} \to 9 + 0 + 0 = 9 \,.
$$
Therefore we can use Theorem \ref{theorem-square-root-limit} to infer
$$
\sqrt{ 9 + \frac{3}{n} + \frac{1}{n^{2}} } \to \sqrt{9}  \,.
$$
By the Algebra of Limits we conclude:
$$
a_n = \frac{3+ \dfrac{1}{n} }{\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{n^{2}} }+ 3 }   \to  \frac{ 3 + 0 }{ \sqrt{9} + 3 } = \frac12 \,.
$$


:::


::: Example 

Prove that the sequence
$$
a_n = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-2 n

does not converge.

> *Proof.* We rewrite $a_n$ as

a_n & = \sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}-2 n  \\
& =\frac{  (\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1} - 2 n)  (\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+2 n) }{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+2 n} \\
& =\frac{9 n^{2}+3 n+1-(2 n)^{2}}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+2 n} \\
& =\frac{5 n^{2}+3 n+1}{\sqrt{9 n^{2}+3 n+1}+2 n} \\
& =\frac{5 n + 3 +  \dfrac{1}{n} }{\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 } } + 2 } \\
& = \frac{b_n}{c_n} \,,
\end{align*}
where we factored $n$, being it the largest power of $n$ in the denominator, and defined
$$
b_n : = 5 n + 3 +  \dfrac{1}{n}\,, \quad 
c_n := \sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 } } + 2 \,.
$$
Note that 
$$
9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 }  \to 9
$$
by the Algebra of Limits. Therefore 
$$
\sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 }}  \to \sqrt{9} = 3 
$$
by Theorem \ref{theorem-square-root-limit}. Hence 
$$
c_n = \sqrt{9+ \dfrac{3}{n}  + \dfrac{1}{ n^2 }} + 2 \to 3 + 2 = 5  \,.
$$
The numerator 
$$
b_n = 5 n + 3 +  \dfrac{1}{n}
$$
is instead unbounded. Therefore $(a_n)$ is not convergent, by the Algebra of Limits and the usual contradiction argument.

## Example: Heron's Method


The first explicit algorithm for approximating 
$$
\sqrt{x}
$$ 
for $x > 0$ is known as **Heron's method**, after the first-century Greek mathematician [Heron of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) who described the method in his AD 60 work Metrica, see reference to
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method).

Let us see what is the idea of the algorithm:

- Suppose that $a_1$ is an approximation of $\sqrt{x}$ from above, that is,
$$
 \sqrt{x} < a_1 \,.
$$ {#eq-heron}
- Multiplying (@eq-heron) by $\sqrt{x}/a_1$ we obtain
$$
\frac{x}{a_1} < \sqrt{x} \,,

obtaining an approximation of $\sqrt{x}$ from below.
- Therefore, putting together the above inequalities,
$$
\frac{x}{a_1} < \sqrt{x} < a_1 
$$ {#eq-heron-2}
- If we take the average of the points $x/a_1$ and $a_1$, it is reasonable to think that we find a better approximation of $\sqrt{x}$. Thus our next approximation is
$$
a_2 := \frac{1}{2} \left( a_1 + \frac{x}{a_1} \right) \,,
$$
see figure below.


![Heron's Algorithm for approximating $\sqrt{x}$](/images/heron.png){width=70%}


Iterating, we define by recurrence the sequence 
$$
a_{n+1} := \frac12  \left( a_n + \frac{x}{a_n} \right)
$$
for all $n \in \N$, where the initial guess $a_1$ has to satisfy (@eq-heron). The aim of the section is to show that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty } \ a_n = \sqrt{x} \,.
$${#eq-heron-convergence}
We start by showing that (@eq-heron-2) holds for all $n \in \N$.

::: {.Proposition  #proposition-heron}
We have
$$
\frac{x}{a_n} < \sqrt{x} < a_n 
$${#eq-heron-3}
for all $n \in \N$.
:::


::: Proof
We prove it by induction:

1. By (@eq-heron) and (@eq-heron-1) we know that (@eq-heron-3) holds for $n=1$. 

2. Suppose now that (@eq-heron-3) holds for $n$. Then
\begin{align}
a_{n+1} - \sqrt{x} & = \frac12  \left( a_n + \frac{x}{a_n} \right) - \sqrt{x} \\
& = \frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n^2 + x - 2 a_n \sqrt{x} ) \\
& = \frac{1}{2 a_n} ( a_n - \sqrt{x} )^2 > 0 \,,
\end{align}
since we are assuming that $a_n > \sqrt{x}$. Therefore
$$
\sqrt{x} < a_{n+1} \,.
$${#eq-heron-proof-1}
Multiplying the above by $\sqrt{x}/a_{n+1}$ we get
$$
\frac{x}{a_{n+1}} < \sqrt{x} \,.
$${#eq-heron-proof-2}
Inequalities (@eq-heron-proof-1) and (@eq-heron-proof-2) show that (@eq-heron-3) holds for $n+1$.

Therefore we conclude (@eq-heron-3) by the Principle of Induction.

We are now ready to prove error estimates, that is, estimating how far away $a_n$ is from $\sqrt{x}$. 


::: Proposition
### Error estimate {#proposition-heron-error}
For all $n \in \N$ we have
$$
a_{n+1} - \sqrt{x} < \frac12 (a_{n} - \sqrt{x}) \,.
$${#eq-heron-half}
:::


::: Proof
By Proposition \ref{proposition-heron} we know that 
$$
\frac{x}{a_n} < \sqrt{x}
$$
for all $n \in \N$. Therefore
\begin{align}
a_{n+1} & = \frac12 \left(  a_n +  \frac{x}{a_n}   \right) \\
        & < \frac12 \left(  a_n +  \sqrt{x}   \right) \,.
\end{align}
Subtracting $\sqrt{x}$ from both members in the above inequality we get the thesis.
:::


Inequality (@eq-heron-half) is saying that the error halves at each step. Therefore we can prove that after $n$ steps the error is exponentially lower, as detailed in the following proposition.


::: {.Proposition #proposition-heron-error-exp}
For all $n \in \N$ we have
$$
a_{n+1} - \sqrt{x} < \frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \sqrt{x})
$$ {#eq-heron-error}
:::



::: Proof
We prove (@eq-heron-error) by induction:

1. For $n=1$ we have that (@eq-heron-error) is satisfied, since it coincides with (@eq-heron-half) for $n=1$.
2. Suppose that (@eq-heron-error) holds for $n$. By (@eq-heron-half) with $n$ replaced by $n+1$ we have
\begin{align}
a_{n+2} - \sqrt{x} & < \frac12 (a_{n+1} - \sqrt{x}) \\
& < \frac12 \,\cdot \, \frac{1}{2^n} (a_{1} - \sqrt{x}) \\
& = \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} (a_{1} - \sqrt{x})
\end{align}
where in the second inequality we used the induction hypothesis (@eq-heron-error). Hence (@eq-heron-error) holds for $n+1$.

By invoking the Induction Principle we conclude the proof.
:::

Let us comment estimate (@eq-heron-error). Denote the error at step $n$ by
$$
e_n := a_n - \sqrt{x}\,.
$$
The initial error $e_1$ depends on how far the initial guess is from $\sqrt{x}$. The estimate in (@eq-heron-error) is telling us that $e_n$ is a fraction of $e_1$, and actually
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \ e_n = 0
$$
exponentially fast. From this fact we are finally able to prove (@eq-heron-convergence).

::: Theorem
### Convergence of Heron's Algorithm
We have that 
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \ a_n = \sqrt{x} \,.
$$
:::

::: Proof
By Proposition \ref{proposition-heron-error-exp} we have that
$$
a_{n+1} - \sqrt{x} < \frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \sqrt{x})
$$
Moreover Proposition \ref{proposition-heron} tells us that
$$
\sqrt{x} < a_{n+1} \,.
$$
Putting together the two inequalities above we infer
$$
\sqrt{x} < a_{n+1} < \sqrt{x} + \frac{1}{2^n} (a_1 - \sqrt{x}) \,.
$${#eq-heron-final}
Now note that
$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \ \frac{1}{2^n} =
\lim_{n \to \infty} \ \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = 0 \,.
$$
Therefore the RHS of (@eq-heron-final) converges to $\sqrt{x}$ as $n \to \infty$. Applying the Squeeze Theorem to (@eq-heron-final) we conclude that $a_n \to \sqrt{x}$ as $n \to \infty$.

### Coding the Algorithm

Heron's Algorithm can be easily coded in Python. For example, see the function below:

```python
# x is the number for which to compute sqrt(x)
# guess is the point a_1
# a_1 must be strictly larger than sqrt(x)
# n is the number of iterations
# the function returns a_{n+1}

def herons_algorithm(x, guess, n):
    for i in range(n):
        guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2.0
    return guess
```

For example let us use the Algorithm to compute $\sqrt{2}$ after $3$ iterations. For initial guess we take $a_1 = 2$. 

```python
# Calculate sqrt(2) with 3 iterations and guess 2
sqrt_2 = herons_algorithm(2, 2, 3)

print(f"The sqrt(2) is approximately {sqrt_2}")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false 

def herons_algorithm(x, guess, n):
    for i in range(n):
        guess = (guess + x / guess) / 2.0
    return guess

# Calculate sqrt(2) with 3 iterations and guess 2
sqrt_2 = herons_algorithm(2, 2, 3)

print(f"The sqrt(2) is approximately {sqrt_2}")
```

That is a pretty good approximation in just $3$ iterations!
