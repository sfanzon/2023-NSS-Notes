# Real Numbers


In this chapter we introduce the sysyem of Real Numbers $\R$. 


## Fields

In order to introduce $\R$, we need the concepts of **binary operation** and **field**. We proceed in a general setting, starting from a set $K$.


::: Definition
### Binary operation
A binary operation on a set $K$ is a function 
$$
\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K
$$
which maps the ordered pair $(x,y)$ into $x \circ y$.
:::


::: Notation
There are two main binary operations we are interested in:

- **Addition**: denoted by $+$. The addition, or **sum** of $x,y \in K$ is denoted by 
$$
x + y \,.
$$
- **Multiplication**: denoted by $\cdot$. The multiplication, or **product** of $x,y \in K$ is denoted by 
$$
x \cdot y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, xy\,.
$$
:::


::: Example
### of binary operation  {#example-binary-operation}

Let $K=\{0,1\}$. We can for example define the operations of sum and product according to the tables 
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 + & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0 & 0 & 1 \\
 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
\qquad \qquad
\begin{array}{c|cc}
\cdot & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
    0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{array}
$$
The above mean that 
$$
0+0 = 1+1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1\,, 
$$
$$
0 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 \cdot 1 = 1  \,.
$$
This is just one option. Note that we could not have defined 
$$
1 + 1  = 2\,,
$$
since $2 \notin K$.
:::

Binary operations take ordered pairs of elements of $K$ as input. Therefore the operation
$$
x \circ y \circ z
$$
does not make sense, since we do not know which one between
$$
x \circ y  \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, y \circ z
$$
has to be performed first. Also one could have that the outcome of an operation depends on order:
$$
x \circ y \neq y \circ x \,.
$$
This motivates the following definition. 


::: Definition
Let $K$ be a set and $\circ \ \colon K \times K \to K$ be a binary operation on $K$. We say that:

1. $\circ$ is **commutative** if $\forall \, x,y \in K$
    $$
    x \circ y = y \circ x \,.
    $$
2. $\circ$ is **associative** if $\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    $$
    (x \circ y) \circ z = x \circ (y \circ z) \,.
    $$
3. An element $e \in K$ is called **neutral element** of $\circ$ if $\forall \, x \in K$
    $$ 
    x \circ e = e \circ x = e \,.
    $$
4. Let $e$ be a neutral element of $\circ$ and let $x \in K$. An element $y \in K$ is called an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $\circ$ if 
$$
x \circ y = y \circ x = e \,.
$$
:::


::: {.Example #example-binary-operation-2}

Let $K$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ be as in Example \ref{example-binary-operation}. For the sum we have

- $+$ is commutative, since 
$$
0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 0 \,.  
$$
- $+$ is associative, since for example 
$$
(0 + 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 + (1 + 1) = 0 + 0 = 0 \,,  
$$
and therefore 
$$
(0 + 1) + 1 = 0 + (1 + 1) \,.
$$
In general one can show that $+$ is associative by checking all the other permutations. 
- The neutral element of $+$ is $0$, since 
$$
0 + 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 + 0 = 0 + 1 = 1 \,.
$$
- Every element has an inverse. Indeed, the inverse of $0$ is $0$, since 
$$
0 + 0 = 0\,,
$$
while the inverse of $1$ is $1$, since
$$
1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 0 \,.
$$

For the product we have:

- $\cdot$ is commutative, since 
$$
1 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,.
$$
- $\cdot$ is associative, since for example 
$$
(0 \cdot 1) \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,, \quad 0 \cdot (1 \cdot 1) = 0 \cdot 1 = 0 \,,  
$$
and therefore 
$$
(0 \cdot 1) \cdot 1 = 0 \cdot (1 \cdot 1) \,.
$$
By checking all the other permutations one can show that $\cdot$ is associative.
- The neutral element of $\cdot$ is $1$, since 
$$
0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \,, \quad 1 \cdot 1 =  1 \,.
$$
- The element $0$ has no inverse, since  
$$
0 \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot 0 = 0\,,
$$
and thus we never obtain the neutral element $1$. The inverse of $1$ is given by $1$, since 
$$
1 \cdot 1 = 1 \,.
$$
:::


::: Example
Let $K=\{0,1\}$ be a set with binary relation $\circ$ defined by the table
$$
\begin{array}{c|cc}
 \circ & 0 & 1 \\ \hline
 0     & 1 & 1 \\
 1     & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}	
$$
In this case $\circ$ is not commutative since 
$$
0 \circ 1 = 1 \, , \quad 1 \circ 0 = 0
$$
and therefore
$$
0 \circ 1 \neq 1 \circ 0 \,.
$$
Moreover $\circ$ is not associative, since 
$$
(0 \circ 1) \circ 1 = 1 \circ 1 = 0 \,,
$$
while 
$$
0 (\circ 1 \circ 1) = 0 \circ 0 = 1 \,.
$$

We are ready to define fields.





::: Definition
### Field

Let $K$ be a set with binary operations of **addition** 
$$
+\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x + y 
$$
and **multiplication** 
$$
\cdot\ \colon K \times K \to K \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x \cdot y  = xy \,. 
$$ 
We call the triple $(K, + , \cdot)$ a **field** if:

1. The addition $+$ satisfies: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (A1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x+y = y+x 
    $$
    $$
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) 
    $$
    - (A2) **Additive Identity**: There exists a **neutral element** in $K$ for $+$, which we call $0$. It holds:
    $$ 
    x + 0 = 0 + x = x 
    $$
    - (A3) **Additive Inverse**: There exists an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $+$. We call this element the **additive inverse** of $x$ and denote it by $-x$. It holds
    $$
    x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 
    $$

2. The multiplication $\cdot$ satisifes: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    - (M1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x \cdot y = y \cdot x 
    $$
    $$
    (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) 
    $$
    - (M2) **Multiplicative Identity**: There exists a **neutral element** in $K$ for $\cdot$, which we call $1$. It holds:
    $$ 
    x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x 
    $$
    - (M3) **Multiplicative Inverse**: If $x \neq 0$ there exists an **inverse** of $x$ with respect to $\cdot$. We call this element the **multiplicative inverse** of $x$ and denote it by $x^{-1}$. It holds
    $$
    x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 0 
    $$
    by $y=x^{-1}$.

3. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$ are related by 
    - (AM) **Distributive Property**: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in K$
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (y \cdot z) \,.
    $$
:::


::: Example
Let $K$ with $+$ and $\cdot$ be as in Example \ref{example-binary-operation}. We can show that $(K,+,\cdot)$ is a field. Indeed we have already shown in Example \ref{example-binary-operation-2} that: 

- (A1) and (M1) hold, 
- (A2) holds with neutral element $0$,
- (M2) holds with neutral element $1$,
- (A3) every element has an additive inverse, with
$$
-0 = 0 \,, \quad - 1 = 1 \,,
$$
- (M3) every element which is not $0$ a multiplicative inverse, with
$$
1^{-1} = 1\,.
$$

We are left to show the Distributive Property (AM). Indeed:

- (AM) For all $y,z \in K$ we have
$$
0 \cdot (y + z) = 0 \,, \quad (0 \cdot y) + (0 \cdot z) = 0 + 0 = 0\,,
$$
and also
$$
1 \cdot (y + z) = y + z \,, \quad (1 \cdot y) + (1 \cdot z) = y + z \,.
$$
Thus (AM) holds.
:::



::: Definition
### Subtraction and division
Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. We define:

- **Subtraction** as the operation $-$ defined by 
$$
x - y := x + (-y) \,, \quad \forall \, x , y \in K \,,
$$
where $-y$ is the additive inverse of $y$.
- **Division** as the operation $/$ defined by
$$
x/y := x \cdot y^{-1}\,, \quad \forall \, x , y \in K \,, \,\, y \neq 0 \,,
$$
where $y^{-1}$ is the multiplicative inverse of $y$.
:::



::: Proposition
### Uniqueness of neutral elements and inverses

Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. Then

1. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $0$,
2. There is a unique element in $K$ with the property of $1$,
3. For all $x \in K$ there is a unique additive inverse $-x$,
4. For all $x \in K$, $x \neq 0$, there is a unique multiplicative inverse $x^{-1}$.
:::

::: Proof
1. Suppose that $0 \in K$ and $\tilde{0} \in K$ are both neutral element of $+$, that is, they both satisfy (A2). Then 
$$
0 + \tilde{0} = 0
$$
since $\tilde{0}$ is a neutral element for $+$. Moreover
$$
\tilde{0} + 0 = \tilde{0}
$$
since $0$ is a neutral element for $+$. By commutativity of $+$, see property (A1), we have
$$
0 = 0 + \tilde{0} = \tilde{0} + 0 = \tilde{0} \,,
$$
showing that $0 = \tilde{0}$. Hence the neutral element for $+$ is unique.
2. Exercise.
3. Let $x \in K$ and suppose that $y, \tilde{y} \in K$ are both additive inverses of $x$, that is, they both satisfy (A3). Therefore
$$
x + y = 0
$$
since $y$ is an additive inverse of $x$ and
$$
x + \tilde{y} = 0 
$$
since $\tilde{y}$ is an additive inverse of $x$. Therefore we can use commutativity and associativity and of $+$, see property (A1), and the fact that $0$ is the neutral element of $+$, to infer
\begin{align}
y & = y + 0 = y + (x + \tilde{y}) \\ 
  & = (y + x) + \tilde{y} = (x + y) + \tilde{y} \\
  & = 0 + \tilde{y} = \tilde{y} \,,    
\end{align}
concluding that $y = \tilde{y}$. Thus there is a unique additive inverse of $x$, and 
$$
y = \tilde{y} = -x \,,
$$
with $-x$ the element from property (A3).
4. Exercise.
:::



Using the properties of field we can also show that the usual properties of sum, subtraction, multiplication and division still hold in any field. We list such properties in the following proposition.


::: Proposition
### Properties of field operations
Let $(K,+,\cdot)$ be a field. Then for all $x,y,z \in K$,

- $x + y = x + z \,\, \implies \,\, y = z$
- $x \cdot y = x \cdot z \,$ and $\,x \neq 0 \,\, \implies \,\, y = z$
- $- 0 = 0$
- $1^{-1} = 1$
- $x \cdot 0 = 0$
- $-1 \cdot x = -x$
- $-(-x) = x$
- $(x^{-1})^{-1} = x \,$ if $\, x \neq 0$
- $(x \cdot y)^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot y^{-1}$ 
:::




The above properties can be all proven with elementary use of the field properties (A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3) and (AM). This is an exercise in patience, and is left to the reader.



Let us conclude with examining the sets of numbers introduced in @sec-chap-1. 

::: Theorem
Consider the sets $\N$, $\Z$, $\Q$ with the usual operations $+$ and $\cdot$. We have:

- $(\N, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**:  
It satisfies properties (A1), (A2), (M1), (M2), (AM) of fields. It is missing properties (A3) and (M3), the additive and multiplicative inverse properties, respectively.
- $(\Z, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**:  
It satisfies properties (A1), (A2), (A3), (M1), (M2), (AM) of fields. Thus it is only missing (M3), the multiplicative inverse property.
- $(\Q, + , \cdot)$ **is a field**.


:::

The proof is omitted. 




## Ordered fields

::: Definition
Let $K$ be a set with binary operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and with an order relation $\leq$. We call $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ an **ordered field** if:

1. $(K,+,\cdot)$ is a field

3. There $\leq$ is of **total order** on $K$:  $\, \forall \, x, y, z \in K$ 
    - (O1) **Reflexivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq x
    $$ 
    - (O2) **Antisymmetry**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \, \mbox{ and } \, y \leq x \,\, \implies \,\, x = y 
    $$
    - (O3) **Transitivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, y \leq z \,\, \implies \,\, x = z 
    $$
    - (O4) **Total order**:  
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, y \leq x 
    $$

4. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and the total order $\leq$, are related by the following properties: $\, \forall x, y, z \in K$
    - (AM) **Distributive**: Relates addition and multiplication via
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z 
    $$
    - (AO) Relates addition and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \implies \,\, x + z \leq y + z
    $$
    - (MO) Relates multiplication and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0  \,\, \implies \,\, x \cdot y  \geq 0
    $$
:::


::: Example 
$(\Q,+,\cdot,\leq)$ is an **ordered field**.
:::



## Cut Property  

We have just introduced the notion of **field**, and noted that the set of rational numbers with the usual operations
$$
(\Q, + , \cdot)
$$
is a **field**. 

We now need to address the key issue we proved in @sec-chap-1, that is, that
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,.
$$
This means that $\Q$ has **gaps**, and cannot be represented as a **continuous** line. The rigorous definition of **lack of gaps** needs the concept of **cut** of a set.



::: Definition
### Partition of a set

Let $S$ be a set. The pair $(A,B)$ is a **partition** of $S$ if
$$
A , B \subset S\,, \quad  A \neq \emptyset\,, \quad B \neq \emptyset \,,
$$
and
$$
S = A \cup B \,, \quad 
A \cap B = \emptyset \, . 
$$
:::

::: Definition
### Cut of a set

Let $S$ be a set with a total order relation $\leq$. The pair $(A,B)$ is a **cut** of $S$ if 

1. $(A,B)$ is a **partition** of $S$,
2. We have
$$
a \leq b \,,  \quad \forall \, a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
:::

The **cut** of a set is often called **Dedekind cut**, named after **Richard Dedekind**, who used cuts to give an explicit construction of the real numbers $\R$, see [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_cut).


::: Definition 
### Cut property
Let $S$ be a set with a total order relation $\leq$. We say that $S$ has the **cut property** if for every cut $(A,B)$ of $S$ there exists some $s \in S$ such that 
$$
a \leq s \leq b \,, \quad \forall  \, a \in A\,, \,\, \forall  \, b \in B \,.
$$
We call $s$ the **separator** of the cut $(A,B)$.
:::




::: Example
Let $S = \Q$ and consider the sets
$$
A = (-\infty,s] \cap \Q \,, \quad B = (0,\infty) \cap \Q \,. 
$$
for some $s \in \Q$. Then the pair $(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$, and $s$ is the separator.
:::


![$(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$ with separator $s$.](/images/cut.png){width=70%}


::: Question
Do all ordered fields have the Cut Property? Does $\Q$ have the Cut Property?
:::


The answer to the above question is **NO**. For example the pair
$$
A =  (-\infty,\sqrt{2}) \cap \Q \,, \quad B = (\sqrt{2},\infty) \cap \Q\,.
$${#eq-cut-Q}
is a cut of $\Q$, since $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$. However what is the separator? It should be $s = \sqrt{2}$, given that clearly 
$$
a \leq \sqrt{2}  \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A\,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
However $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, so we are **NOT ALLOWED** to take it as separator. Indeed, we can show that $(A,B)$ defined as in (@eq-cut-Q) has no separator.



![$(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$ which has no separator](/images/cut_sqrt2.png){width=70%}







::: Theorem
### $\Q$ does not have the cut property.

$\Q$ does not have the cut property. More explicitly, there exist a cut $(A,B)$ of $\Q$ which has no separator.
:::

::: Proof
Let $A$ and $B$ be the sets defined in (@eq-cut-Q). It is useful to rewrite $A$ and $B$ in the form
$$
A = A_1 \cup A_2 \,, 
$$
where 
$$
A_1 = \{ q \in \Q \divider q< 0  \}\,, 
$$
$$
A_2 =\{ q \in \Q \divider q \geq 0\,, \,\, q^2 < 2  \} \,,
$$
and
$$
B = \{ q \in \Q \divider q > 0, \,\, q^2 > 2  \} \,.
$$

*Step 1. $(A,B)$ is a cut of $\Q$*:  
We need to prove the following:

1. $(A,B)$ is a partition of $\Q$. This is because $A , B \subset \Q$ with $A \neq \emptyset$ and $B \neq \emptyset$. Moreover 
$A \cap B = \emptyset$ and
$$
A \cup B = \Q\,,
$$ 
given that $\sqrt{2} \notin \Q$, and so there is no element $q \in \Q$ such that $q^2 = 2$.
2. It holds
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$$
Indeed, suppose that $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. We have two cases:
    - $a \in A_1$: Therefore $a<0$. In particular
    $$
    a < 0 < b\,,
    $$
    given that $b > 0$ for all $b \in B$. Thus $a<b$.
    - $a \in A_2$: Therefore $a \geq 0$ and $a^2 < 2$. In particular
    $$
    a^2 < 2 < b^2 \,,
    $$
    since $b^2>2$ for all $b \in B$. In particular 
    $$
    a^2 < b^2 \,.
    $$
    Since $b>0$ for all $b \in B$, from the above inequality we infer $a<b$, concluding.



*Step 2. $(A,B)$ has no separator*:  
Suppose by contradiction that $(A,B)$ admits a separator
$$
L \in \Q \,.
$$
By definition this means
$$
a \leq L \leq b \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,, \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction}
Since
$$
L \in \Q \,, \quad \Q = A \cup B \,, \quad  A \cap B = \emptyset \,,
$$
then either $L \in A$ or $L \in B$. We will see that both these possibilities lead to a contradiction:

*Case 1: $L \in A$.*  
By (@eq-separator-contradiction) we know that 
$$
a \leq L \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-hp-0}
In particular the above implies 
$$
L \geq 0
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-1}
since $0 \in A$. Therefore we must have $L \in A_2$, that is, 
$$
L \geq 0 \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, L^2 < 2 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-hp-1}
Set 
$$
\tilde{L} := L + \frac1n
$$
for $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Clearly we have
$$
\tilde{L} \in \Q   \,\,\, \mbox{ and } \,\,\, L < \tilde{L}  \,. 
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-2}
From (@eq-separator-contradiction-1) and (@eq-separator-contradiction-2) we have also
$$
\tilde{L}>0 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-3}
We now want to show that there is a choice of $n$ such that $\tilde{L}^2 < 2$, which will lead to a contradiction. Indeed, we can estimate
\begin{align}
\tilde{L}^2 & = \left( L + \frac1n \right)^2 \\
            & = L^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \frac{L}{n} \\
            & < L^2 + \frac{1}{n} + 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n}<\frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
            & = L^2 + \frac{2L + 1}{n} \,. 
\end{align}
If we now impose that 
$$
L^2 + \frac{2L + 1}{n} < 2 \,,
$$
we can rearrange the above and obtain
$$
n(2 - L^2) > 2L + 1 \,.
$$
Now note that $L^2 < 2$ by assumption (@eq-separator-contradiction-hp-1). Thus we can divived by $(2 - L^2)$ and obtain
$$
n >\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2} \,.
$$
Therefore we have just shown that 
$$
n >\frac{2L + 1}{2 - L^2}  \,\, \implies \,\, \tilde{L}^2 < 2 \,.
$$
Together with (@eq-separator-contradiction-3) this implies $\tilde{L} \in A$. Therefore we have
$$
\tilde{L} \leq L
$$
by (@eq-separator-contradiction-hp-0). On the other hand it also holds 
$$
\tilde{L} > L
$$
by (@eq-separator-contradiction-2), and therefore we have a contradiction. Thus $L \notin A$.

*Case 2: $L \in B$.*  
As $L \in B$, we have by definition
$$
L > 0 \,, \quad L^2 > 2 \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-5}
Moreover since $L$ is a separator, see (@eq-separator-contradiction), in particular
$$
L \leq b \,,  \,\, \forall \, b \in B \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-6}
Define now 
$$
\tilde{L} := L - \frac1n
$$
with $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Clearly we have
$$
\tilde{L} < L \,.
$${#eq-separator-contradiction-7}
We now show that $n$ can be chosen so that $\tilde{L} \in B$. Indeed
\begin{align}
\tilde{L}^2  & = \left(  L - \frac1n   \right)^2 \\
             & = L^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{L}{n} \\
             & > L^2 - \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
             & > L^2 - \frac{1}{n} - 2 \frac{L}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, -\frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n}  \right) \\
             & = L^2 - \frac{1 + 2L}{n} \,.
\end{align}
Now we impose 
$$
L^2 - \frac{1 + 2L}{n} > 2 
$$
which is equivalent to 
$$
n(L^2 - 2) > 1 + 2L \,.
$$
Since we are assuming $L \in B$, then $L^2 > 2$, see (@eq-separator-contradiction-5). Therefore we can divide by $(L^2 -2)$ and get
$$
n > \frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \,.
$$
In total, we have just shown that 
$$
 n > \frac{1+2L}{L^2 - 2} \quad \implies \quad \tilde{L}^2 > 2\,,
$$
proving that $\tilde{L} \in B$. Therefore by (@eq-separator-contradiction-6) we get
$$
L \leq \tilde{L} \,.
$$
This contradicts (@eq-separator-contradiction-7).

*Conclusion:*  
We have seen that assuming that $(A,B)$ has a separator $L \in \Q$ leads to a contradiction. Thus the cut $(A,B)$ has no separator.
:::


::: Remark

The above proof can be summarized by saying that the set
$$
A = (-\infty, \sqrt{2}) \cap \Q
$$
does not admit a **largest** element in $\Q$, and that the set
$$
B = (\sqrt{2}, \infty) \cap \Q
$$
does not admit a **lowest element** in $\Q$. We will clarify this remark in the next section.

## Supremum and infimum


A crucial definition in Analysis is the one of supremum or infimum of a set. This is also another way of studying the **gaps** of $\Q$.


::: Example
### Intuition about supremum and infimum
Consider the set
$$
A = [0,1) \cap \Q \,.
$$
Intuitively, we understand that $A$ is bounded, i.e. not infinite. We also see that

- $0$ is the lowest element of $A$
- $1$ is the highest element of $A$

However we see that $0 \in A$ while $1 \notin A$. We will see that 

- $0$ can be defined as the **infimum** and **minimum** of $A$.
- $1$ can be defined as the **supremum**, but not **maximum**, of $A$. 
:::



### Upper bound, supremum, maximum 

We start by defining the supremum. First we need the notion of upper bound of a set.


::: Definition
### Upper bound and bounded above

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$:

1. We say that $b \in K$ is an **upper bound** for $A$ if
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
2. We say that $A$ is **bounded above** if there exists and upper bound $b \in K$ for $A$.
:::




::: Definition 
### Supremum

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. A number $s \in K$ is called **least upper bound** or **supremum** of $A$ if:

i. $s$ is an upper bound for $A$,
ii. $s$ is the smallest upper bound of $A$, that is, 
    $$
    \mbox{If } \, b \in K \, \mbox{ is upper bound for } \, A \, \mbox{ then } \, s \leq b \,.  
    $$
:::

::: Notation
We will almost always prefer the name supremum to least upper bound. For $A \subset K$ the supremum is denoted by
$$
s := \sup \ A \,.
$$
:::


::: Remark
Note that if a set $A \subset K$ in **NOT** bounded above, then the supremum does not exist, as there are no upper bounds of $A$. 
:::


::: Proposition
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. If 
$$
\sup A
$$
exists, then it is unique.  
:::


::: Proof
Suppose there exist $s_1, s_2 \in K$ such that
$$
s_1 = \sup A,  \,\, s_2 = \sup A \,.
$$
Then:

- Since $s_2 = \sup A$, in particular $s_2$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $s_1 = \sup A$ then $s_1$ is the lowest upper bound. Thus we get
$$
s_1 \leq s_2 \,.
$$
- Exchanging the roles $s_1$ and $s_2$ in the above reasoning we also get
$$
s_2 \leq s_1 \,.
$$

This shows $s_1 = s_2$.
:::




::: Warning
In general:

- A set can have infinite upper bounds,
- The supremum does not belong to the set.

For example
$$
A = [0,1)  \cap \Q
$$
has for upper bounds all the numbers $b \in \Q$ with $b>1$. Moreover one can show that 
$$
\sup A = 1\,,
$$
and so 
$$
\sup A \notin A \,.
$$
:::

::: Warning 
The supremum does not exist in general. For example let
$$
A = [0,\sqrt{2})  \cap \Q \,.
$$
We will show that $\sup A$ does not exist in $\Q$. Indeed we will have that
$$
\sup A = \sqrt{2} \in \R \,.
$$
:::

::: Definition 
### Maximum
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. A number $M \in K$ is called the **maximum** of $A$ if:
$$
M \in A   \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, a \leq M  \,, \, \forall a \in A \,.
$$
We denote the maximum by
$$
M = \max A \,.
$$
:::



::: Proposition
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. If the maximum of $A$ exists, then also the supremum exists, and
$$
\sup A = \max A \,.
$$
:::

::: Proof
Let 
$$
M = \max A \,.
$$ 
Then:

- By definition we have $M \in A$ and 
$$
a \leq M \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
In particular the above tells us that $M$ is an upper bound of $A$. 
- We claim that $M$ is the least upper bound. Indeed, suppose $b$ is an upper bound of $A$, that is,    
$$
a \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
In particular, since $M \in A$, by the above condition we have
$$
M \leq b \,.
$$

Therefore $M$ is the least upper bound of $A$, meaning that $M = \sup A$.
:::


::: Warning
The converse of the above statement is not true: In general the $\sup$ might exist while the $\max$ does not. For example
$$
A = [0,1) \cap \Q
$$
is such that 
$$
\sup A = 1
$$
but $\max A$ does not exist. Instead for the set
$$
B = [0,1] \cap \Q
$$
we have that 
$$
\max A = \sup A = 1 \,. 
$$

### Lower bound, infimum, minimum

We now introduce the definitions of lower bound, infimum, minimum. These are the counterpart of upper bound, supremum and maximum, respectively.




::: Definition
### Upper bound, bounded below, infimum, minimum

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$:

1. We say that $l \in K$ is a **lower bound** for $A$ if
$$
l \leq a \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,.
$$
2. We say that $A$ is **bounded below** if there exists a lower bound $l \in K$ for $A$.
3. We say that $i \in K$ is the **greatest lower bound** or **infimum** of $A$ if:

    - $i$ is a lower bound for $A$,
    - $i$ is the largest lower bound of $A$, that is, 
    $$
    \mbox{If } \, l \in K \, \mbox{ is a lower bound for } \, A \, \mbox{ then } \, l \leq i \,.  
    $$
If it exists, the infimum is denoted by 
$$
i = \inf A \,.
$$
4. We say that $m \in K$ is the **minimum** of $A$ if:
$$
m \in A   \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, m \leq a  \,, \, \forall a \in A \,.
$$
If it exists, we denote the minimum by
$$
m = \min A \,.
$$
:::



![Infimum and lower bounds of a set $A$ in the field $K$](/images/definition_infimum.png){width=70%}




::: Proposition
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$:

1. If $\inf A$ exists, then it is unique.
2. If the minimum of $A$ exists, then also the infimum exists, and
$$
\inf A = \min A \,.
$$  

:::

The proof uses similar arguments to the one employed in the previous section, and is left to the reader as an exercise.




::: Warning
We have

- A set can have infinite lower bounds,
- The infimum does not belong to the set.

For example
$$
A = (0,1)  \cap \Q
$$
has for lower bounds all the numbers $b \in \Q$ with $b<1$. Moreover we will show that
$$
\inf A = 0\,,
$$
and so 
$$
\inf A \notin A \,.
$$
:::

::: Warning 
The infimum does not exist in general. For example let
$$
A = (\sqrt{2},5]  \cap \Q \,.
$$
We will show that $\inf A$ does not exist in $\Q$. Indeed we will have that
$$
\inf A = \sqrt{2} \in \R \,.
$$
:::


::: Warning
In general the $\inf$ might exist while the $\min$ does not. For example
$$
A = (0,1) \cap \Q
$$
is such that 
$$
\inf A = 0
$$
but $\min A$ does not exist. Instead for the set
$$
B = [0,1] \cap \Q
$$
we have that 
$$
\inf A = \min A = 0 \,. 
$$
:::




::: Proposition
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. If $\inf A$ and $\sup A$ exist, then
$$
\inf A \leq a \leq \sup A \,, \quad \forall a \in A \,.
$$
:::

The proof is simple, and is left as an exercise. We now have a complete picture about supremum and infimum, see figure below.



![Supremum, upper bounds, infimum and lower bounds of a set $A$ in $K$](/images/definition_sup_inf.png){width=70%}






We conclude with another simple proposition. The proof is again left to the reader.

### Relationship between sup and inf {#proposition-inf-sup}

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field and $A \subset K$. 
Define 
$$
- A := \{ - a \divider a \in A \} \,.

It holds:

- If $\sup A$ exists, then $\inf A$ exists and
$$
\inf(-A) = - \sup A \,.

- If $\inf A$ exists, then $\sup A$ exists and

\sup(-A) = - \inf A \,.

## Completeness


We have introduced the concepts of supremum and infimum on an ordered field $K$. 


::: Question
Suppose $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ is an ordered field, and that $A \subset K$ is non-empty and bounded above. Does
$$
\sup A 
$$
always exist?
:::

The answer to the above question is **NO**. Like we did with the Cut Property, the counterexample can be found in the set of rational numbers $\Q$. A set bounded above for which the supremum does nor exist is, for example, 
$$
A = [0, \sqrt{2}) \cap \Q \,.
$${#eq-no-sup-in-Q}


::: {.Theorem  #theorem-Q-not-complete}
There exists a set $A \subset \Q$ such that 

- $A$ is non-empty,
- $A$ is bounded above,
- $\sup A$ does not exist in $\Q$. 
:::

The proof uses the same ideas we used for showing that $\Q$ does not have the Cut Property.

::: Proof
Define the set $A$ as in (@eq-no-sup-in-Q). Equivalently, this can be written as
$$
A = \{ q \in \Q  \divider q \geq 0 \,, \,\, q^2 < 2 \} \,.
$$

*Step 1. $A$ is bounded above.*  
Take $b:=9$. Then $b$ is an upper bound for $A$. Indeed by definition 
$$
q^2 < 2 \,, \,\, q \geq 0 \,, \,\,\, \forall q \in A \,.
$$
Therefore 
$$
q^2 < 2 < 9  \implies q^2 < 9 \implies q < 3 = b \, .
$$

*Step 2. $\sup A$ does not exist.*  
Assume by contradiction that 
$$
s = \sup A \in \Q
$$
exists. By definition it holds
$$
s \geq q \,, \quad \forall \, q \in A
$$ {#eq-sup-contradiction-1}
$$
b \geq q \,, \, \forall \, q \in A \,\, \implies \,\, 
s \leq b 
$$ {#eq-sup-contradiction-2}
There are two possibilities: $s \in A$ or $s \notin A$:

- *Case 1. $s \in A$*.  
If $s \in A$ by definition
$$
s  \geq 0\,, \quad s^2 < 2 \,.
$${#eq-sup-contradiction-3}
Define 
$$
\tilde{s} := s + \frac{1}{n}
$$
with $n \in \N$, $n \neq 0$ to be chosen later. Then
\begin{align}
\tilde{s}^2 & = \left( s + \frac1n \right)^2 \\
            & = s^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} + 2 \frac{s}{n} \\
            & < s^2 + \frac{1}{n} + 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n}<\frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
            & = s^2 + \frac{2s + 1}{n} \,. 
\end{align}
If we now impose that 
$$
s^2 + \frac{2s + 1}{n} < 2 \,,
$$
we can rearrange the above and obtain
$$
n(2 - s^2) > 2s + 1 \,.
$$
Now note that $s^2 < 2$ by assumption (@eq-sup-contradiction-3). Thus we can divide by $(2 - s^2)$ and obtain
$$
n >\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2} \,.
$$
To summarize, we have just shown that 
$$
n >\frac{2s + 1}{2 - s^2}  \,\, \implies \,\, \tilde{s}^2 < 2 \,.
$$
Moreover $\tilde{s} := (s + 1/n) \in \Q$. Therefore
$$
\tilde{s} \in A \,.
$$
Since $s = \sup A$, we then have
$$
\tilde{s} \leq s \,.
$$
However 
$$
\tilde{s} := s + \frac{1}{n} > s \,,
$$
yielding a contradiction. Thus $s \in A$ is not possible. 

- *Case 2. $s \notin A$*.  
If $s \notin A$, by the fact that $s = \sup A$ and by definition of $A$ we get
$$
s > 0 \,, \quad s^2 > 2 \,.
$${#eq-sup-contradiction-4}  
Define 
$$
\tilde{s} := s - \frac{1}{n} \,.
$$
We have
\begin{align}
\tilde{s}^2  & = \left(  s - \frac1n   \right)^2 \\
             & = s^2 + \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{s}{n} \\
             & > s^2 - \frac{1}{n^2} - 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, \frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n^2}  \right) \\
             & > s^2 - \frac{1}{n} - 2 \frac{s}{n}   \qquad  \left(\mbox{using } \, -\frac{1}{n^2} > - \frac{1}{n}  \right) \\
             & = s^2 - \frac{1 + 2s}{n} \,.
\end{align}
Now we impose 
$$
s^2 - \frac{1 + 2s}{n} > 2 
$$
which is equivalent to 
$$
n(s^2 - 2) > 1 + 2s \,.
$$
By (@eq-sup-contradiction-4) we have $s^2 > 2$. Therefore we can divide by $(s^2 -2)$ and get
$$
n > \frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \,.
$$
In total, we have just shown that 
$$
 n > \frac{1+2s}{s^2 - 2} \quad \implies \quad \tilde{s}^2 > 2\,.
$$
Therefore $\tilde{s} \notin A$, and by definition of $A$ we have
$$
\tilde{s} \geq q \,, \quad \forall q \in A\,.
$$
Moreover $\tilde{s} := (s - 1/n) \in \Q$. Therefore $\tilde{s}$ is an upper bound of $A$ in $\Q$. Since $s=\sup A$ is the smallest upper bound, see (@eq-sup-contradiction-2), it follows
$$
s \leq \tilde{s} \,.
$$
However 
$$
\tilde{s} := s - \frac{1}{n} < s \,,
$$
obtaining a contradiction. Then $s \notin A$. 

*Conclusion.*  
We have assumed by contradiction that $s = \sup A$ exists in $\Q$. In this case either $s \in A$ or $s \notin A$. In both cases we found a contradiction. Therefore $\sup A$ does not exist.    
:::

The above theorem shows that the supremum does not necessarily exist. What about the infimum? 


::: Question
Suppose $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ is an ordered field, and that $A \subset K$ is non-empty and bounded below. Does
$$
\inf A 
$$
always exist?
:::

The answer to the above question is again **NO**. A set bounded below for which the infimum does nor exist is, for example, 
$$
A = (\sqrt{2}, 10] \cap \Q \,.
$$
The proof of this fact is, of course, very similar to the one of Theorem \ref{theorem-Q-not-complete}, and is therefore omitted.


Thus infimum and supremum do not exist in general. The fields for which all the bounded sets admit supremum or infimum are called **complete**.


::: Definition
### Completeness

Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be an ordered field. We say that $K$ is **complete** if it holds the property:

- (AC) For every $A \subset K$ non-empty and bounded above 
$$
\sup A \in K \,.
$$

:::


::: Notation
We have that:

- Property (AC) is called **Axiom of Completeness**
- If $K$ is an ordered field in which (AC) holds, then $K$ is called a **complete ordered field**
:::


Notice that if the **Axiom of Completeness** holds, then also the infimum exists. This is shown in the following proposition.


::: Proposition
Let $(K,+,\cdot,\leq)$ be a complete ordered field. Suppose that $A \subset K$ is non-empty and bounded below. Then 
$$
\inf A \in K\,.
$$
:::

::: Proof
Suppose that $A \subset K$ is non-empty and bounded below. Then 
$$
-A:= \{ -a \divider a \in A   \}
$$
is non-empty and bounded above. By completeness we have that $\sup(-A)$ exists in $K$. But then Proposition \ref{proposition-inf-sup} implies that $\inf A$ exists in $K$, with
$$
\inf A = - \sup (-A)\,. 
$$
:::






We can show that **Completeness** is equivalent to the **Cut Property**.  


::: Theorem 
### Equivalence of Cut Property and Completeness  {#theorem-cut-complete}
Let $(K,+,\cdot, \leq)$ be an ordered field. Then they are equivalent:

1. $K$ has the **Cut Property**
2. $K$ is **Complete**

## Axioms of Real Numbers

We now have all the key elements to introduce the Real Numbers $\R$. These ingredients are

- Definition of **ordered field**
- The **Cut Property** or **Axiom of Completeness**

The definition of $\R$ is given in an axiomatic way.


::: Definition
### System of Real Numbers $\R$

A system of Real Numbers is a set $\R$ satisfying the following properties:


1. There is an operation $+$ of **addition** on $\R$ 
$$
+\ \colon \R \times \R \to \R \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x + y 
$$
The addition satisifes: $\,\forall \, x,y,z \in \R$
    - (A1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x+y = y+x 
    $$
    $$
    (x+y)+z = x+(y+z) 
    $$
    - (A2) **Additive Identity**: $\,\exists \, 0 \in \R \st$
    $$ 
    x + 0 = 0 + x = x 
    $$
    - (A3) **Additive Inverse**: $\, \exists \, (-x) \in \R \st$
    $$
    x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0 
    $$

2. There is an operation $\cdot$ of **multiplication** on $\R$
$$
\cdot\ \colon \R \times \R \to \R \,, \quad (x,y) \mapsto x \cdot y  = xy 
$$ 
The multiplication satisifes: $\, \forall \, x,y,z \in \R$
    - (M1) **Commutativity and Associativity**: 
    $$
    x \cdot y = y \cdot x
    $$
    $$
    (x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z) 
    $$
    - (M2) **Multiplicative Identity**: $\, \exists \, 1 \in \R \st$
    $$ 
    x \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot x = x 
    $$
    - (M3) **Multiplicative Inverse**: If $x \neq 0 \,, \,\, \exists \, x^{-1} \in \R \st$
    $$
    x \cdot x^{-1} = x^{-1} \cdot x = 1 
    $$



3. There is a relation $\leq$ of **total order** on $\R$. The order satisfies: $\, \forall \, x, y, z \in \R$ 
    - (O1) **Reflexivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq x
    $$ 
    - (O2) **Antisymmetry**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \, \mbox{ and } \, y \leq x \,\, \implies \,\, x = y 
    $$
    - (O3) **Transitivity**: 
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ and } \,\, y \leq z \,\, \implies \,\, x = z 
    $$
    - (O4) **Total order**:  
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \mbox{ or } \,\, y \leq x 
    $$

4. The operations $+$ and $\cdot$, and the total order $\leq$, are related by the following properties: $\, \forall x, y, z \in \R$
    - (AM) **Distributive**: Relates addition and multiplication via
    $$
    x \cdot (y + z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z 
    $$
    - (AO) Relates addition and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \leq y \,\, \implies \,\, x + z \leq y + z
    $$
    - (MO) Relates multiplication and order with the requirement:
    $$
    x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0  \,\, \implies \,\, x \cdot y  \geq 0
    $$

5. **Cut Property** holds:
    - (CP) Every cut $(A,B)$ of $\R$ admits a **separator** $s \in \R \, \st$
    $$
    a \leq s \leq b \,, \quad \forall \, a \in A \,, \,\forall \, b \in B 
    $$  

:::



::: Remark
Since **Cut Property** and **Axiom of Completeness** are equivalent by Theorem \ref{theorem-cut-complete}, one can replace the Cut Property at Point 5 with:  

5. **Axiom of Completeness** holds:
    - (AC) For every $A \subset \R$ non-empty and bounded above 
    $$
    \sup A \in \R
    $$ 
:::


::: Notation
For $x \in \R$, $x \neq 0$, the multiplicative inverse is also denoted by 
$$
x^{-1} = \frac{1}{x} \,.
$$
:::







::: Remark

Recall that

- $(K,+,\cdot)$ satisfying
$$
\mbox{(A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3), (AM)}
$$ 
is a **field** 
- $(K,+,\cdot, \geq)$ satisfying 
$$
\mbox{(A1)-(A3), (M1)-(M3), (O1)-(O4) ,(AM), (AO), (MO)}
$$ 
is an **ordered field**

In particular we have:

- $(\N, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**
- $(\Z, + , \cdot)$ is **not a field**
- $(\Q, + , \cdot)$ is a **field**
- $(\Q,+, \cdot,\geq)$ is an **ordered field**
- $(\R,+, \cdot,\geq)$ is a **complete ordered field**: that is, an ordered field in which the **Cut Property** (CP) or **Axiom of Completeness** (AC) hold
:::



::: Important
It can be shown that $(\R,+, \cdot,\geq)$ is the **only** complete ordered field.   
:::

The above has to be intended in the following sense: if $(K,+, \cdot,\geq)$ is another complete ordered field, then $K$ *looks like* $\R$. Mathematically this means that there exists an invertible map 
$\Psi \ \colon \R \to K$, called isomorphism of fields, which preserves $+$, $\cdot$ and $\leq$.


::: Question
We have only postulated the existence of $\R$. Does such complete ordered field actually exist? 
:::

The answer is **YES**, and there are several models for such $\R$. If time allows, we will look into one of these constructions towards the end of the module.
