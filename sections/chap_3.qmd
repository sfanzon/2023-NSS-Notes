# Real Numbers

In @sec-chap-1 we proved that 
$$
\sqrt{2} \notin \Q \,,
$$
where $\Q$ is the set of rational numbers. Therefore $\Q$ has a **gap**, and cannot be represented as a **continuous** line. Let us make this concept more precise, by giving a mathematical definition of **gap**.


## Cut Property  

The rigorous definition of **gap** is given in terms of **cuts** of a set.
