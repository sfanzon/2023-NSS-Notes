# Properties of $\mathbb{R}$

Now that we established the axiomatic definition of the Real Numbers $\R$ as a **complete ordered field**, let us investigate some of the properties of $\R$. These will be consequence of the axioms of the real numbers, particulaly of the **Axiom of Completeness**.



## Special subsets of $\R$







## Archimedean Property

The Archimedean property is one of the most useful properties of $\R$, and it essentially states that the set of natural numbers $\N$ is not bounded above in $\R$. 


More precisley, the Archimedean Property says two things:

1. For any $x \in \R$ we can always find a natural number $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > x \,.
$$

2. For any $x \in \R$ with $x>0$, we can always find a natural number $m \in \N$ such that 
$$
0< \frac1m < x  \,.
$$

The situation is depicted in @fig-archimedean.


![For any $x>0$ we can find $n,m \in \N$ such that $1/m<x<n$.](/images/archimedean_original.png){#fig-archimedean width=80%}


::: Remark
The Archimedean property might sound trivial. However there are examples of ordered fields $K$ that satisfy:

1. $\N \subset K$.
2. $K$ does not have the Archimedean property.
3. In particular, $\N$ is bounded above in $K$. 

Of course such fields $K$ cannot be complete. 

> If $K$ is complete, then $K$ is essentially $\R$, and we are going to prove the Archimedean
Property holds in $\R$.
:::


Let us proceed with the precise statement of the Archimedean property in $\R$.


::: Theorem
### Archimedean Property   {#theorem-archimedean}

Let $x \in \R$ be given. Then:

1. There exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > x \,.
$$

2. Suppose in addition that $x>0$. There exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
\frac1n < x \,.
$$


:::




::: Proof

*Part 1.* Let $x \in \R$. Suppose by contradiction that there is no $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n > x  \,.
$$
This means that 
$$
n \leq x \, \quad \forall n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-2}
The above is saying that the set $\N$ is bounded above. Since $\N$ is not empty, by the Axiom of Completeness there exists
$$
\alpha = \sup \N \,.
$$

*Claim: $(\alpha-1)$ is not an upper bound for $\N$.*

*Proof of Claim.* Indeed, we have
$$
(\alpha - 1) < \alpha \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof}
Therefore $\alpha-1$ cannot be an upper bound for $\N$. Indeed, if by contradiction $\alpha - 1$ was an upper bound for $\N$, then we would have
$$
\alpha \leq (\alpha - 1)\,, 
$$
since $\alpha$ is the smallest upper bound for $\N$. This contradicts (@eq-archimedean-proof). Therefore $\alpha - 1$ is not an upper bound for $\N$. 

*Conclusion.* Since $\alpha - 1$ is not an upper bound for $\N$, there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
\alpha - 1 < n_0 \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
\alpha < n_0 + 1 \,.
$$
Since 
$$
(n_0+1) \in \N \,,
$$
we have obtained a contradiction, given that $\alpha$ was the supremum of $\N$. Thus (@eq-archimedean-proof-2) is false, meaning that there exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
n > x \,.
$$



*Part 2.* Suppose $x \in \R$ with $x>0$. We can define
$$
y:=\frac1x \,.
$$
By Part 1 there exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
n > y = \frac{1}{x} \,.
$$
Using that $x>0$, we can rearrange the above inequlaity to obtain
$$
\frac1n < x \,,
$$
which is the desired thesis.

:::




There is another formulation of the Archimedean Property which, depending on the situation, might
be more useful. This formulation says the following: If $x,y \in \R$ are such that 
$$
0 < x < y \,,
$$
then there exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$
In other words, if one does $n$ steps of size $x$ in the positive numbers direction, then
the resulting number $nx$ will be larger than $y$. The situation is depicted in @fig-archimedean. 




![For $0<x<y$ there exists $n \in \N$ such that that $nx>y$. In the picture $n=3$.](/images/archimedean.png){#fig-archimedean width=80%}



::: Theorem
### Archimedean Property (Alternative formulation)  {#theorem-archimedean-alternative}

Let $x,y \in \R$, with $0<x<y$. There exists $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof


Suppose by contradiction that there does not exist some $n \in \N$ such that 
$$
nx > y \,.
$$
This means that
$$
nx \leq y \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-4}
Define the set
$$
A := \{ nx \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
Condition (@eq-archimedean-proof-4) is saying that $A$ is bounded above by $y$. Morever $A$ is trivially non-empty. By the Axiom of Completeness there exists
$$
\alpha = \sup A \,.
$$
Since $\alpha$ is the supremum of $A$, by definition of supremum and of the set $A$, we have 
$$
nx \leq \alpha \,, \quad   \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-archimedean-proof-5}
As (@eq-archimedean-proof-5) holds for every $n \in \N$, then it also holds for $(n+1)$, meaning that
$$
(n+1) x \leq \alpha \,.
$$
The above implies 
$$
nx \leq \alpha - x \,.
$$
As $n$ was arbitrary, we conclude that
$$
nx \leq \alpha - x \,, \quad   \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
The above is saying that $(\alpha - x)$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since $\alpha$ is the supremum of 
$A$, in particular $\alpha$ is the smallest upper bound. Thus it must hold
$$
\alpha \leq \alpha - x \,.
$$
The above is equivalent to 
$$
x \leq 0 \,,
$$
which contradicts our assumption of $x>0$. Therefore (@eq-archimedean-proof-4) is false, and there exists $n \in \N$ such that
$$
nx > y \,,
$$
concluding the proof.
:::







## Nested Interval Property



Another consequence of the axiom of completeness is the **Nested Interval Property**. This is yet another way of saying
the same thing: $\R$ does not have **gaps**. 

Let us look at a construction. Suppose given some closed intervals
$$
I_n := [a_n,b_n] = \{   x \in \R \divider  a_n \leq x \leq b_n   \} \,,
$$
where the end points are ordered in the following way:
$$
a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_n \leq \dots \leq b_n  \leq \ldots b_n \leq b_1 \,,
$$
as shown in @fig-nested. 

![Nested intervals $I_n = [a_n,b_n]$.](/images/nested_interval_property.png){#fig-nested width=80%}


The intervals $I_n$ are **nested**, meaning that 
$$
I_1 \supset I_2 \supset I_3 \supset \ldots I_n \supset \ldots
$$
For finite intersections we clearly have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^k  I_n = I_k \,, 
$$
that is, intersecting the first $k$ intervals yields $I_k$, the smallest interval in the sequence.

::: Question

Consider the infinite intersection

$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n := \{  x \in \R \divider x \in I_n \,, \forall \, n \in \N  \}  \,.
$$

What can we say about it? Is it empty? Is it not empty?
:::

The answer is that the infinite intersection is not empty, because $\R$ was constructed in a way that it does not have gaps.




::: Theorem
### Nested Interval Property  {#theorem-nested}


For each $n \in \N$ assume given a closed interval
$$
I_n := [a_n,b_n] = \{   x \in \R \divider  a_n \leq x \leq b_n   \} \,.
$$
Suppose that the intervals are nested, that is,
$$
I_n \supset I_{n+1}\,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Then
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \neq \emptyset \,.
$${#eq-theorem-nested-proof-0}
:::


::: Proof 

By definition we have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n := \{  x \in \R \divider x \in I_n \,, \forall \, n \in \N  \}  \,.
$$
We want to prove (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-0). This means we need to find a real number $x$ such that
$$
x \in I_n \,, \quad  \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-theorem-nested-proof-1}

> Idea of the Proof: Condition (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-1) is saying that it should hold
$$
x \geq a_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
We might be tempted to choose $x$ to be any of the $b_n$. This choice would indeed satisy 
the above. However (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-1) also implies that
$$
x \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore $x$ has to be larger than all the $a_n$, but not too large. This suggests that 
$x$ should be defined as a supremum. 

Define the set
$$
A:= \{ a_n \divider n \in \N \} \,.
$$
The set $A$ is non-empty and is bounded above by any of the $b_n$. Therefore there exists 
$$
x = \sup \ A \,.
$$
By definition of supremum and definition of the set $A$, we have
$$
a_n \leq x \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
On the other hand, consider an arbitrary number $b_n$. By construction we have
$$
a_i \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, i \in \N \,.
$$
Therefore $b_n$ is an upper bound for $A$. Since the supremum is the smallest upper bound, 
we conclude that
$$
x \leq b_n \,.
$$
The index $n$ was chosen arbitrarily, and therefore
$$
x \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
In total we have
$$
a_n \leq x \leq b_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $x$ satisfies (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-1). Therefore (@eq-theorem-nested-proof-0) holds and the proof is concluded.
::::


::: Important

The assumption that $I_n$ is **closed** is crucial in Theorem \ref{theorem-nested}. 
Without such assumption the thesis of Theorem \ref{theorem-nested} does not hold in general, as seen in Example \ref{example-nested-open} below.

:::


::: {.Example #example-nested-open}

Consider the **open** intervals 
$$
I_n := \left( 0, \frac1n \right) \,.
$$
These are clearly nested
$$
I_n \supset I_{n+1}\,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
For this choice of $I_n$ we have
$$
\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \emptyset \,.
$${#eq-example-nested-2}
Indeed, suppose by contradiction that the intersection is non-empty. Then there exists $x \in \N$
such that 
$$
x \in I_n \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
By definition of $I_n$ the above reads
$$
0 < x < \frac1n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$${#eq-example-nested}
Since $x>0$, by the Archimedean Property in Theorem \ref{theorem-archimedean} Point 2, there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
0 < \frac{1}{n_0} < x \,.
$$
The above contradicts (@eq-example-nested). Therefore (@eq-example-nested-2) holds.

## Revisiting Sup and inf 


We now investigate some of the properties of supremum and infimum in $\R$. 
The first property is an alternative characterization of the supremum, which we will often use. A sketch of such characterization is in @fig-alternative-sup below.

::: Proposition 
### Characterization of Supremum  {#proposition-supremum-characterization}

Let $A \subset \R$ be a non-empty set. Suppose that $s \in \R$ is an upper bound for $A$. They 
are equivalent:

1. $s = \sup A$
2. For every $\e > 0$ there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
s - \e < x \,.
$$

:::


![Let $s = \sup A$. Then for every $\e>0$ there exist $x \in A$ such that $s-\e<x$.](/images/alternative_supremum.png){#fig-alternative-sup width=80%}


::: Proof
### Proof of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization}

*Step 1*. Assume that 
$$
s = \sup A \,.
$$
Let $\e>0$ be arbitrary. We clearly have that
$$
s - \e < s \,.
$${#eq-proof-sup-alt-1}
Therefore $(s-\e)$ cannot be an upper bound of $A$. Indeed, if by contradiction $(s-\e)$ was 
an upper bound, then we would have
$$
s \leq (s - \e )\,,
$$
since $s$ is the smallest upper bound. The above contradicts (@eq-proof-sup-alt-1), and therefore
$(s-\e)$ is not an upper bound for $A$. Hence there exists some $x \in A$ such that
$$
s - \e < x  \, ,
$$
concluding.

*Step 2*. Assume that Point 2 in the statement of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization} holds. By assumption we have that $s$ is an upper bound 
for $A$. Suppose by contradiction that 
$$
s \neq \sup A \,.
$$
This is equivalent to the statement
$$
s \, \mbox{ is not the smallest upper bound of } \, A. 
$${#eq-proof-sup-alt-2}
Hence there exists an upper bound $b$ of $A$ such that
$$
b < s \,.
$$
Let
$$
\e := s - b \,.
$$
By assumption there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
s - \e < x \,.
$$
Substituting the definition of $\e$ we get
$$
s - s + b < x \quad \implies \quad b < x \,.
$$
Since $b$ is an upper bound for $A$ and $x \in A$, the above is a contradiction. Therefore 
(@eq-proof-sup-alt-2) is false, and $s$ is the smallest upper bound of $A$. Thus $s = \sup A$.
:::




The analogue of Proposition \ref{proposition-supremum-characterization} is as follows. The proof is left as an exercise. 


::: Proposition 
### Characterization of Infimum  {#prop-supremum-infimum}

Let $A \subset \R$ be a non-empty set. Suppose that $i \in \R$ is a lower bound for $A$. They 
are equivalent:

1. $i = \inf A$
2. For every $\e \in \R$, with $\e > 0$, there exists $x \in A$ such that 
$$
x < i + \e  \,.
$$

:::


A sketch of the characterization in Proposition \ref{prop-supremum-infimum} can be found in @fig-alternative-inf below.

![Let $i = \inf A$. Then for every $\e>0$ there exist $x \in A$ such that $x<i+\e$.](/images/alternative_infimum.png){#fig-alternative-inf width=80%}



With the above characterizations of supremum and infimum, it is now easier to
prove that some candidate number is the supremum or infimum of some set.
As an example, let us characterize supremum and infimum of an open interval of $\R$.


::: {.Proposition  #proposition-interval-inf-sup}

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a < x < b \}\,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,.
$$

:::


::: Proof

We will only prove that 
$$
\inf A = a \,,
$$
since the proof of 
$$
\sup A = b
$$ 
is similar. 

By definition of $A$, we have that 
$$
a < x \,, \quad \forall \, x \in A \,.
$$
The above says that $a$ is a lower bound for $A$. 

*Claim. $a$ is the largest lower bound of $A$*. 

*Proof of Claim.* Let $L$ be a lower bound for $A$, that is,
$$
L \leq x \,, \quad \forall \, x \in A \,.
$$
We have to prove that
$$
L \leq a \,.
$${#eq-interval-inf-sup-proof}
Indeed suppose by contradiction that (@eq-interval-inf-sup-proof) does not hold, namely that
$$
a < L \,.
$$
Since $a<b$ we have
$$
a = \frac{2a}{2} < \frac{a+b}{2} < \frac{2b}{b} = b \,,
$$
showing that the midpoint between $a$ and $b$ satisfies
$$
\frac{a+b}{2} \in A \,.
$$
Since $L$ is a lower bound for $A$ we have
$$
L \leq \frac{a+b}{2} < b \,.
$${#eq-interval-inf-sup-proof-2}
Consider the midpoint
$$
M := \frac{a + L}{2} \,. 
$$
We have that 
$$
M \in A \,.
$$

> Indeed, recalling that $a<L$, we have
$$
a = \frac{2a}{2} < \frac{a+L}{2} = M \,. 
$$
Moreover by (@eq-interval-inf-sup-proof-2) we have $L<b$. Thus
$$
M = \frac{a+L}{2} \leq \frac{a+b}{2} < b \,.
$$
This shows $M \in A$.


Moreover 
$$
M < L \,.
$$

> This is because $a<L$, and therefore
$$
M = \frac{a + L}{2} < \frac{2L}{2} = L \,.
$$


This is a contradiction, since by assumption $L$ is a lower bound for $A$, and thus we should have 
$$
L \leq M \,.
$$
Therefore (@eq-interval-inf-sup-proof) holds, showing that $a$ is the largest lower bound of $A$. Thus $a = \inf A$.
:::





As a corollary of the above we have that the maximum and minimum of an open interval do not exist.




::: Corollary

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= (a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a < x < b \}\,.
$$
Then $\min A$ and $\max A$ do not exist.
:::

::: Proof

Suppose by contradiction that $\min A$ exists. We have shown that if the minimum of a set exists, then it must be
$$
\min A = \inf A \,.
$$
Since 
$$
\inf A = a\,,
$$
by Proposition \ref{proposition-interval-inf-sup}, we would obtain that
$$
\min A = a \,.
$$
By definition $\min A \in A$, so that $a \in A$. This is contradiction. Then $\min A$ does not exist. 

The proof that $\max A$ does not exist is similar, and is left as an exercise.
:::


We can also consider intervals for which one or both of the sides are closed.


::: Corollary

Let $a, b \in \R$ with $a<b$. Let
$$
A:= [a,b) = \{ x \in \R \divider a \leq x < b \}\,.
$$
Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A = a \,, \quad \sup A = b \,,
$$ 
$\max A$ does not exist.


:::


The proof is very similar to the ones above, and is left to the reader for exercise. Let us now compute supremum and infimum of 
a set which is not an interval.


::: Proposition

Define the set
$$
A :=  \left\{ \frac1n \divider n \in \N   \right\} \,.
$$
Then
$$
\inf A = 0 \,, \quad \sup A = \max A = 1 \,.
$$
:::


::: Proof

*Part 1.* We have
$$
\frac1n \leq 1 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,.
$$
Since $1 \in A$, we conclude that 
$$
\max A = \sup A = 1 \,.
$$


*Part 2.* We have
$$
\frac1n > 0 \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$$
showing that $0$ is a lower bound for $A$. Suppose by contradiction that $0$ is not the infimum. Therefore $0$ is not the largest lower bound. Then there exists $\e \in \R$ such that:

- $\e$ is a lower bound for $A$, that is,
$$
\e \leq \frac1n  \,, \quad \forall \, n \in \N \,,
$${#eq-lower-bound-1-n}

- $\e$ is larger than $0$:
$$
0 < \e \,.
$$

As $\e>0$, by the Archimedean Property there exists $n_0 \in \N$ such that
$$
0 < \frac{1}{n_0} < \e \,.
$$
This contradicts (@eq-lower-bound-1-n). Thus $0$ is the largest lower bound of $A$, that is, $0 = \inf A$.


*Part 3.* We have that $\min A$ does not exist. Indeed suppose by contradiction that $\min A$ exists. Then 
$$
\min A = \inf A \,.
$$
As $\inf A = 0$ by Part 2, we conclude $\min A = 0$. As $\min A \in A$, we obtain $0 \in A$, which is a contradiction.

## Density of $\Q$ in $\R$


In this section we show that $\Q$ is dense in $\R$. Density can be explained in two equivalent ways:

- For every given number $x \in \R$, there exists
a rational number $r \in \Q$ which is arbitrarily close to $x$. 

- For every pair of $a,b \in \R$ with $a<b$, there exists $r \in \Q$ such that
$$
a < r < b \,.
$$

In other words, the above statements are saying that $\Q$ and $\R$ are tightly knitted together. 
Let us give a proof of this statement.


::: Theorem 
### Density of $\Q$ in $\R$    {#theorem-density}

Let $a,b \in \R$, with $a<b$. There exists $r \in \Q$ such that
$$
a < r < b \,.
$$

:::


The density result of Theorem \ref{theorem-density} has a surprising corollary. Indeed, we have
constructed the real numbers $\R$ so that they would fill the **gaps** of $\Q$. 

::: Question

How many gaps does $\Q$ have? In other words, how many irrational numbers are out there?

:::


The answer is that there are as many irrational numbers 
as there are real numbers. Moreover for every pair of real numbers, we can always find
and irrational number in between.


::: Corollary

Let $a,b \in \R$, with $a<b$. There exists $t \in (\R \smallsetminus \Q)$ such that
$$
a < t < b \,.
$$
