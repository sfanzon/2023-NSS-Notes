# Properties of $\mathbb{R}$

Now that we established the axiomatic definition of the Real Numbers $\R$ as a **complete ordered field**, let us investigate some of their properies. These will all be consequence of the axioms of the real numbers, particulaly of the **completeness axiom**.


## Nested Interval Property

Not sure

## Archimedean Property

Notes, or Dommers. See prop on dommers too.

![For $0<a<b$ there exists $n \in \N$ so that $na>b$. In the picture $n=3$](/images/archimedean.png){width=60%}


## Revisiting Sup and inf 

1. Characterize sup and inf with epsilon (see Marcellini)
2. Compute sup and inf of interval (a,b) - Dommers
3. Compute sup and inf of 
$$
\left\{ \frac1n \divider n \in \N  \,, \,\, n \neq 0 \right\}
$$
see Dommers



## Density of $\Q$ in $\R$

## Existence of Square Roots






## Cardinality

Brief. Use Dommers
