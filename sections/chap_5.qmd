# Complex Numbers


We have seen that $\sqrt{x}$ exists in $\R$ for all for $x \geq 0$.
We defined
$$
\sqrt{x}:= \alpha \,, \quad \alpha := \sup \{ t \in \R \divider t^2 < x  \}\,,
$$
and proved that
$$
\alpha^2 = x \,.
$$
This procedure is only possible if $x \geq 0$: there does not exist, e.g., a number $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ such that 
$$
\alpha^{2}=-1 \,.
$$
To overcome this difficulty, the **imaginary numbers** or **complex numbers**  were introduced. We define $i$ to be that *number* such that
$$
i^{2}=-1 \,.
$$
Formally, we can also think of $i=\sqrt{-1}$. We can use this
to define, for $x<0$,
$$
\sqrt{x}: = i \sqrt{-x} \,.
$$
Note that $\sqrt{-x}$ is properly defined in $\mathbb{R}$, because
$-x>0$ if $x<0$. 


## Definition of $\C$


We would like to be able to do calculations with the newly introduced complex numbers, and investigate their properties. We can introduce them
rigorously as a field, as we did for $\mathbb{R}$. 


::: Definition
### Complex Numbers

The set of complex numbers $\C$ is defined as

$$
\C := \R \oplus i \R  := \{x \oplus i y  \divider x, y \in \R \} \,.
$$

:::

In the above the symbol $\oplus$ is used to denote the pair
$$
x \oplus i y = (x,y)
$$
with $x,y \in \R$. This means that $x$ and $y$ play different *roles*.


::: Definition

For a complex number
$$
z = x \oplus i y  \in \C
$$
we say that

- $x$ is the **real part** of $z$, and denote it by 
$$
x = \Re (z)
$$
- $y$ is the **imaginary part** of $z$, and denote it by 
$$
y = \Im (z)
$$

We say that

- If $\Re z = 0$ then $z$ is a **purely imaginary** number.
- If $\Im z = 0$ then $z$ is a **real** number.

In order to make the set $\mathbb{C}$ into a field, we first have to define the two binary operations of addition $+$ and multiplication $\cdot$, 
$$
+ , \cdot \,\, \colon \C \times \C \to \C \,.
$$
Then we need to prove that these operations satisfy all the field axioms.


::: Definition
### Addition in $\C$

Let $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, so that 
$$
z_1 = x_1 \oplus i y_1 \,\,, \quad z_2 = x_2 \oplus i  y_2 \,\, ,
$$
for some $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 \in \R$. We define the sum of $z_1$ and
$z_2$ as
$$
z_1 + z_2 = \left( x_{1} \oplus i y_{1} \right)+ \left(x_{2} \oplus i y_{2} \right):=\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right) \oplus i  \left(y_{1}+y_{2}\right) 
$$
where the $+$ symbol on the right hand side is the addition operator in $\mathbb{R}$. 

:::

Clearly, $z_1 + z_2$ as defined above is an element of $\C$. Therefore
$+$ defines a binary operation over $\C$.


::: Notation

From the above definition, we have that, for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, 

$$
(x \oplus i 0 )+(0 \oplus i y)= x \oplus i y .
$$
To simplify notation, we will write 
$$
x \oplus i 0 = x \,, \quad \,  0 \oplus i y  = i y 
$$ 
and 
$$
x \oplus i y = x + i y \,.
$$
We will also often swap $i$ and $y$, writing equivalently
$$
x + i y = x + y i \,.
$$


:::


We now want to define multiplication between complex numbers. This has to keep into account
that 
$$
i^{2}=i \cdot i=-1 \,.
$$
Let us do some formal calculations: For $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1, z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$ we have

\begin{align*}
z_1 \cdot z_2 & = \left(x_{1}+i y_{1}  \right) \cdot \left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right) \\
& = x_{1} \cdot x_{2} + x_{1} \cdot i y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot i y_{1} + y_{1} \cdot i^2 y_{2}   \\
& = \left(x_{1} \cdot x_{2} - y_{1} \cdot y_{2} \right) + i \left(x_{1} \cdot y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot y_{1} \right)  
\end{align*}

The above motivates the following definition of multiplication.


::: Definition
### Multiplication in $\C$ 

Let $z_1,z_2 \in \C$, so that 
$$
z_1 = x_1 \oplus i y_1 \,\,, \quad z_2 = x_2 \oplus i  y_2 \,\, ,
$$
for some $x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 \in \R$. We define the multiplication of 
$z_1$ and $z_2$ as 
$$
z_1 \cdot z_2 = \left(x_{1}+i y_{1} \right) \cdot\left(x_{2}+ i y_{2} \right) := \left(x_{1} \cdot x_{2} - y_{1} \cdot y_{2}\right) + i \left(x_{1} \cdot y_{2} + x_{2} \cdot y_{1} \right) \,,
$$
where the operations $+$ and $\cdot$ on the right hand side are the operations in $\R$.

:::

Clearly, $z_1 \cdot z_2$ as defined above is an element of $\C$. Therefore
$\cdot$ defines a binary operation over $\C$.



::: {.Remark #remark-complex-i}

To check that we have given a good definition of product, we should
have that
$$
i^2 = - 1\,,
$$
as expected. Indeed:

\begin{align*}
i^{2} & = (0+ 1 i) \cdot (0+ 1 i) \\
      & = (0 \cdot 0 - 1 \cdot 1) + (0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 1) i = - 1 \,.
\end{align*}
:::



::: Important

In view of Remark \ref{remark-complex-i}, we see that 
the formal calculations we have done above are compatible with 
the definition of multiplication of complex numbers. Therefore, it is not necessary to memorize the formula, but it suffices to carry out calculations as usual, and replace $i^{2}$ by $-1$.

:::




::: Example

Suppose we want to multiply the complex numbers
$$
z =  -2+3 i \,, \quad w = 1- i \,.
$$
Using the definition we compute
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (-2+3 i) \cdot (1 -  i) \\ 
            & = (-2-(-3))+(2+3) i \\
            & = 1 + 5 i \, .
\end{align*}
Alternatively, we can proceed without using the definition,
and replacing $i^2$ with $-1$:
\begin{align*}
z \cdot w & = (-2+3 i) \cdot (1 -  i) \\ 
            & = - 2 + 2i + 3i - 3 i^2  \\
            & = (-2  + 3 ) + (  2 + 3 ) i \\
            & = 1 + 5 i \, .
\end{align*}

:::



We now want to check that 
$$
(\C, + , \cdot)
$$
is a field. All the field axioms are trivial to check, except for
the existence of additive and multiplicative inverses.


::: Proposition
### Additive inverse in $\C$

The neutral element of addition in $\C$ is the number
$$
0 := 0 + 0 i \,.
$$
For any $z = x + i y \in \C$, the unique inverse is given by
$$
- z := -x - i y \,.
$$


:::


The proof is immediate and is left as an exercise. The multiplication
requires more care.
